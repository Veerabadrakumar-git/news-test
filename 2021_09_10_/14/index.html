 www.newsindiatimes.com  – that’s all you need to know News India Times September 10, 2021 14 Community By a Staff Writer T he Federation of Indian Associations held a farewell reception for India’s Deputy Consul General Shatrughna Sinha and his wife at Akbar Restaurant in Edison, N.J. August 27, 2021. It was attended by more than 150 community leaders. There was high praise for the services he rendered to the Indian American community. And DCG Sinha returned the praise for the community. “You have been an incredible, absolutely incredible representative of the Indian Government,” said Anil Bansal, president of FIA, describing Sinha as a “rare individual,” and going further to praise the support given to FIA because of his liaison. Padma Shri Sudhir Parikh, senior advisor to FIA said Sinha was a quintessential diplomat “who has the pulse of the community and the politics; who knows how to accomplish goals without fanfare; who works for their country’s glory and not their own benefit.” Dr. Parikh assured DCG Sinha he always had friends if he visited U.S. in the future, and hopefully return as the Consul General or Ambassador. Chairman of FIA Ankur Vaidya said, “It’s an honor to have known you, to have called you our friend, to call you our fraternity brother of FIA.” He thankedMrs. Sinha for allowing DCG Sinha to spend inordinately long hours fulfilling his duties and working with the Indian American community. EdisonMayoral Candidate Sam Joshi told the DCG, “You havemade great strides representing the Indian community. I am so honored to be in your presence.” Joshi noted Edison has the highest percentage of Indians in the U.S. A brief prayer was said by a priest to felicitate DCG Sinha and his wife. Numerous people garlanded him in appreciation. “During my tenure a few important things (happened),” DCG Sinha said. “FIA completed fifty years. Not many organizations last 50 years. It speaks volumes for what FIA has done.” “Today is a day of mixed feelings,” Sinha continued. He called his three years in New York “Very exciting, very fulfilling, and very satisfying.” That was mainly because of leaders like Dr. Sudhir Parikh and Ankur Vaidya, he said speaking as he was flanked by Dr. Parikh and Vaidya. The New York Consulate serves 10 states, Sinha noted. “With help of organizations like FIA, our reach is extended, our reach is magnified.” He particularly thanked the FIA for its work for India, every time any assistance is needed. “Especially during the Covid pandemic, we have received lot of support from FIA, not only in terms of individual contributions but also as an organization, in helping routing aid fomUnited States to India,” Sinha said, noting that FIA has received the Pravasi Bharatiya award, “and they totally deserve it.” TV Asia founder and CEO H.R. Shah recited a shayari in Hindi, complimenting DCG Sinha for raising the community so high and keeping it close to his heart. Dr. Avinash Gupta, chairman of the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America, and Dr. Namisha Shukla also spoke. Several other FIA leaders interviewed by ITV Gold praised Sinha highly. Past President of FIA Alok Kumar said it would be hard to replace a man like Sinha who gave his all to working with the community. Member Board of Trustees Srujal Parikh called him “an amazing diplomat, very dear to us.” Others present at the event included Anand Patel, Andy Bhatia, Shireesh Sharma among others. Chess Grandmaster Abhimanyu Mishra was presented a check of $5,000 by FIA at the event. Farewell!
