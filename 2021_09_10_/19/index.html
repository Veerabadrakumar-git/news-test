 www.newsindiatimes.com  – that’s all you need to know 19 News India Times September 10, 2021 Entertainment Sidharth Shukla: ARising Star Gone Too Soon ‘Pavitra Rishta’ TransformedMy Life Completely, Says Ankita Lokhande I n a career spanning over 15 years, actor Sidharth Shukla won many hearts with his charming looks, acting prowess, and strong persona both on-screen and off-screen. Unfortunately, the 40-year-old actor embarked on his final journey on Thursday, leaving everyone in a state of grief. Born on December 12 1980 in Mumbai, Sidharth, who held a degree in interior designing, chose to switch gears to the modelling field, where he clinched the runner-up position in Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest in 2004. The modelling stint was followed by his first appearance in a music video titled ‘Resham Ka Rumal’, which was sung by Ila Arun. In 2005, he made Indians proud by winning the World’s Best Model contest held in Turkey. After winning the title, he bagged a few advertisements for some leading brands. Following his successful modelling days, the actor moved to leave a spark in the TV industry with his first acting role in ‘Babul Ka Aangann Chootey Na’ (2008). He later starred in shows such as ‘Jaane Pehchaane Se… Ye Ajnabbi’ and ‘Love U Zindagi’, which also featured Pavitra Punia. He also appeared in an episode of CID and a few episodes of ‘Aahat’. However, it was his role as district collector Shivraj Shekhar in ‘Balika Vadhu’ that earned him widespread acclaim and popularity, including several awards and nominations. His acting skills caught the attention of many leading film production houses and he finally landed a role in Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions’ movie ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’, which starred Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan in the lead roles. Sidharth played the role of Angad Bedi, an NRI doctor and fiance of Alia’s character. The film earned him an award for Breakthrough Supporting Performance (Male) in the 2015 Stardust Awards. Apart from showing off his acting talent in daily soaps, Sidharth unleashed his adventurous side by participating in the popular reality show ‘Khatron Ke Khiladi 7’, which he also won. Viewers also got to see dancing skills in ‘Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6’, however, he was eliminated in the 11th week of the show. He also had some hosting gigs under his belt. Sidharth hosted a few seasons of the famous reality show ‘India’s Got Talent’ alongside comedian Bharti Singh. In 2017, he returned as a leading star in TV shows with Colors’ serial ‘Dil Se Dil Tak’, co-starring Rashami Desai and Jasmin Bhasin. The series was inspired by the Bollywood movie, ‘Chori Chori Chupke Chupke’. However, he left the show in between due to unknown reasons. The best phase of his career started in 2020 with the hit reality show ‘Bigg Boss 13’ that amassed him a fan following like never before. His angry young man avatar, his clashes with co-contestants including Asim Riaz, Rashami Desai, and friendship with Shehnaaz Gill stole the limelight and made him win the show. After featuring in ‘Bigg Boss 13’, his career got a new boom. He then treated fans with his appearance in three music videos back to back: Darshan Rawal’s ‘Bhula Dunga’ (March 2020), Neha Kakkar and Yasser Desai’s ‘Dil Ko Karaar Aaya’ (July 2020) and Tony Kakkar’s ‘Shona Shona’ (November 2020). In the same year, Bigg Boss lovers got a chance to see him in the house again but as a ‘Toofani Senior’ alongside Hina Khan and Gauahar Khan. He was seen boosting the morale of the participants in the show. Sidharth made his digital debut as Agastya Rao in the third season of the romance web series ‘Broken But Beautiful’ opposite Sonia Rathee. The actor’s last appearance on-screen was with Shehnaaz Gill on this year’s ‘Bigg Boss OTT’ and ‘Dance Deewane 3’. Apart from his work, Sidharth was also in the spotlight for his personal life, especially, for his equation with Shehnaaz Gill. Reportedly, he had also been linked with many other actors including Rashami Desai, Arti Singh, and Pavitra Punia. Sidharth is survived by his mother and two sisters, with whom the late star shared a special bond. The actor had time and again expressed his love for his doting mother on social media. -ANI T he popular television show, ‘Pavitra Rishta’ is all set to return with its second season ‘Pavitra Rishta – It’s never too late’, in which Ankita Lokhande is reprising the role of Archana and Shaheer Sheikh is stepping into the shoes of Manav’s character earlier played by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The makers of the show, on Wednesday, released the trailer along with the premiere date — September 15. The 8-part web series created by Ekta R Kapoor will stream on OTT platform ZEE5. Sharing her excitement for the show, Ankita said, “Rarely does one do a role or a project which transforms their lives completely. Pavitra Rishta was that project for me as the love I received from the audience for Archana’s character was unparalleled. So, how could I turn down the opportunity to reprise the role and continue the legacy of Archana? I am so grateful to Ekta and ZEE for reviving Pavitra Rishta and for having faith in me again. I am eager to see the audience’s reaction to Archuu all over again”. As seen in the trailer, the series is a romantic family drama centred around Manav and Archana. The two are set up by their families for an arranged marriage and they fall in love at first sight. To ensure the union, Manav’s family lies about their financial situation. Things begin to crumble once the reality comes out, challenging Archana and Manav’s love for each other. Ekta R Kapoor, Joint Managing Director of Balaji Telefilms Limited, shared, “Some shows and characters leave a big impression on you for years to come. ‘Pavitra Rishta’ was one such show which impacted so many lives and received so much love and good wishes from fans across the world. There could not have been a better timing to bring back the show and honour the legacy of it. I am sure that the fans will give it as much as love and acceptance as they did to the first season”. The show first aired in 2009 on Zee TV, in which late actor Sushant Singh Rajput essayed the role of Manav. Addressing Manav as his “most pure character”, Shaheer Sheikh shared, “It has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me – from the time I was offered the role to eventually being on set and shooting with this amazing unit. It’s been a challenging role to essay, but I have given it my all. In the process of shooting the show, I realised that ‘Manav’ is the most earnest and pure character I’ve ever played and in today’s day and age, such a character is a rarity! Now I only hope that our efforts resonate with the audiences”. Directed by Nandita Mehra and written by Nikita Dhond, Gautam Hegde and Ritu Bhatia, the show is produced by Bhairavi Raichura’s 24 Frames Production. -ANI Bollywood actor and model Sidharth Shukla. Ankita Lokhande, star of TV series ‘Pavitra Rishta’ Twitter @sidharth_shukla Photo: Twitter @anky1912 P opular dance reality show ‘Dance+’ is returning with an all-new season 6, exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar on September 14. The show will witness once again choreographer and director Remo D’ Souza as the Super Judge and Raghav Juyal as the host. This time, episodes will be aired every day, and the show is set to become the first Indian dance reality show to premiere on a digital streaming platform before television. Apart from the contestants, Remo will once again be seen judging three of his dance proteges — Salman Yusuf Khan, Shakti Mohan and Punit Pathak, for their mentorship skills and captaincy. Talking about his return with ‘Dance+’ Season 6, Remo D’ Souza said, “After the past two years, I find myself even more passionate about the craft of dancing. I am glad to make a comeback as the super judge on ‘Dance+’, the biggest dance reality show. This opportunity gives me a scope to share my knowledge of dance, something I dearly love and have built my life on. I know this season will be packed with many mind- blowing performances because Shakti, Salman and Punit are fantastic dancers themselves. What makes this season even more special is the fact that it’s premiering this September on Disney+ Hotstar first, ahead of TV, and viewers getting the chance to enjoy uninterrupted entertainment that we bring them.” Returning captain Punit J. Pathak already has two wins across the previously aired five seasons. Expressing his excitement for the new season, Punit said, “I have been waiting for the return of ‘Dance+’ ever since the last season ended. This season’s exclusive premiere on a platform like Disney+ Hotstar has me thrilled and excited. Mentoring talented individuals and innovating on new techniques on this show has almost been like going back to dance school. What makes this season more memorable is that my two friends – Shakti, will be returning as a captain along with the new captain, Salman, whose journey I’ve been following since the start.” Season 6 of ‘Dance+’ gets bigger with the introduction of an all-new feature that takes the competition several notches higher; the captains and Super Judge can deep-dive and further evaluate performances from the lens of the Super Cam (SCAM). -ANI ‘Dance+’ Season 6 To Start Streaming From September 14
