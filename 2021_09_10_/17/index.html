 17 News India Times September 10, 2021 Employment-Based Immigration Doubles Come October 1st NPZ Law Group, PC Tel: 201-670-0006 x 107 Toll Free: 866-599-3625 www.visaserve.com Immigration O ctober 1st, 2021, will mark the new government fiscal year. Therefore, this year will be great for immigrant professionals seeking employment-based visas. The number of visas will double from 140,000 persons annually to 290,000 in the following fiscal year. This is due to the backlog of applications by relatives of green card hold- ers or US citi- zens because US embassies were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s an update of this change from the NPZ Law Group.: Who Benefits from Doubling Employ- ment-Based Immigration: Thousands of health care profession- als and computer programmers wait- ing for green cards are sponsored by US employers every year. Due to the pandemic, US hospitals are dealing with a significant shortage of nurses, doc- tors, and other healthcare professionals. This explanation will help elucidate that. The EB-3 employment-based immigra- tion category for most immigrant pro- fessionals acquiring green cards is “cur- rent.” Thus, the waiting period is as long as the time the government takes to pro- cess the paperwork for the professional. For registered nurses (RNs), the pro- cess begins when a US employer files a Form I-140 visa petition with the USCIS. The employer can use pre- mium processing to approve the visa petition in weeks instead of months. The USCIS then forwards the approved petition to theNational VisaCenter (NVC) in New England. The nurse must provide various pieces of information to the NVC. The NVC then coordinates with the US Consulate/Embassy in the RN’s home country to schedule the nurse, his/her spouse, and children, for green card in- terviews. The nurse and his/her family can seek admission to the US after the green card applications are approved. The PERMApplication: The US De- partment of Labor (DOL) designates reg- istered nurses as a shortage p r o f e s s i o n . Therefore, the employer need not prove that there are no able, willing and quali- fied US workers for the position. However, the employer must do so for most other jobs, which is called the PERM Labor Certification process. The PERM process (labor certification) en- sures that the admission of immigrant workers to work in the US will not ad- versely affect US workers’ job opportu- nities, working conditions, and wages. The DOL will only approve the PERM application after a US employer dem- onstrates that these are no qualified US workers who have applied for the position and that the employer pays the prevailing wage. Typically, this process can take 7 to 10 months. The employer must submit an I-140 visa petition to the USCIS after approval of the PERM application. What This Means for US Employers: Most immigrant professionals sponsored for green cards by US employers have temporary work visas and work in the US currently. They can then bypass the NVC and the US Embassy, allowing them to apply for adjustment of status to acquire Michael Phulwani David Nachman Ludka Zimovcak Snehal Batra In Memoriam By David H. Nachman, Esq their green cards without leaving the US. However, RNs must give interviews at US Consulates/Embassies in their home countries because there are no temporary work visas for acquir- ing green cards for that position.
