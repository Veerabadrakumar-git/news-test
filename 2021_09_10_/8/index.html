Willie James Attaway, 30, of Cincinnati, and Lamond Johnson, 35, most recently of Cincinnati, are charged by  a 14-count indictment. An indictment is merely an allegation, and defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.. According to the charging document, Attaway and Johnson allegedly conspired to commit five armed robberies on Feb. 8 and 9, 2021. Vipal J. Patel, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Roland Herndon, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms &amp; Explosives (ATF), announced the charges. According to a Sept. 2, 2021, press release from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, specifically, the defendants allegedly brandished a firearm to commit robberies on the following occasions: February 8 – Shell on Montgomery Road in Deerfield Township, February 8 – Shell on Dixie Highway in Hamilton, Ohio, February 9 – Madeira Beverage on Kenwood Road in Madeira, Ohio, February 9 – Sunoco on Kenwood Road in Blue Ash, Ohio, and February 9 – Marathon on North Broadway in Lebanon, Ohio.
