Nanda, considered as the Father of Modern Echocardiography was  quoted in a recently published book “Kamala Harris and the Rise of Indian Americans” edited by Tarun Basu. Nationally and internationally acclaimed, Dr. Nanda’s prolific research and continuing innovations have led to the development of echocardiography as a central diagnostic tool in modern cardiology and dramatically changed the way cardiology is practiced today. According to a press release, among many other innumerable pioneering contributions, his group  was the first to identify the pulmonary valve by echocardiography which resulted in the development of pediatric echocardiography, developed the clinical technique of 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography which has today become the cornerstone of repairing and  replacing diseased cardiac valves in the cardiac catheterization laboratory without recourse to  surgery, invented the treadmill exercise echocardiography most commonly used to detect coronary artery disease non-invasively, pioneered three and four dimensional echocardiography and the use of echocardiography in cardiac pacing and electrophysiology, and introduced and advanced the use of color Doppler technology in the USA and internationally. The color Doppler techniques have revolutionized the diagnosis and assessment of cardiac valve leaks (regurgitation) by preventing the use of invasive cardiac catheterization in most patients. In addition, his group was the first to identify by echocardiography transposition of the great vessels in the newborn, potentially saving the lives of many babies born with cyanosis, and, he was the first to identify a congenital bicuspid aortic valve by echocardiography. His group also pioneered the use of color Doppler and three/fourdimensional echocardiography in diagnosing cardiac abnormalities in the human fetus. The Bulgarian Foundation of Cardiovascular Imaging aptly cited him for “phenomenal accomplishments in all three fields of echocardiography: adult, pediatric and fetal.” Concerned with the demographic differences in the cardiac disorders, Dr. Nanda, while a resident at Seth G.S. Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai (where he did his MBBS and MD before proceeding to the Institute of Cardiology and National Heart Hospital in London for further training in Cardiology), was the first to demonstrate high incidence of myocardial infarction (heart attack) in young adults in India and relationship of diabetes mellitus to myocardial infarction (heart attack). The latter was published in the New England Journal of Medicine with an accompanying editorial citing it as the “most thorough study of an Asiatic population”. A prolific scholar, he has published over 1,000 scientific publications ( over 525 original), 13 books on echocardiography and cardiology, several translated into Italian, French, German and Turkish languages. He has served as the President of USA’s Society of Geriatric Cardiology and also as Editor-in- Chief of the Journal Echocardiography, the first Journal in the world on echocardiography, for a record period of 32 years. As a master of his profession, Dr. Nanda has been and continues to be an outstanding teacher and mentor, training thousands of cardiologists in the United States and abroad, especially India where the Association of Physicians of India declared  “Your efforts have contributed in a major way to the growth and development of medicine, particularly cardiology, in India.  No other outside physician has done so much for India in recent times.” In recognition of his achievements and services, he has been honored around the world by many countries including France, China, Brazil, Argentina, Philippines, Bangladesh, Turkey, Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Mexico and United Arab Emirates, to name a few. Numerous professional societies have recognized him as a Father of Echocardiography/Modern Echocardiography, and  universities have conferred on him their highest academic recognition, the honorary DSc degrees. In USA, he has been awarded the Ellis Island Medal of Honor (the highest civilian award to immigrants), Life Time Achievement Award by the American Society of Echocardiography and the International Award by the American College of Cardiology “for outstanding contributions to cardiovascular medicine and science and for significantly enhancing cardiovascular care throughout the world and for being a role model for others to follow in his footsteps.” He was also the first recipient of the Tufts University (Boston) award in echocardiography. The Navin Nanda Endowed Scholar Award has also been established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham in his honor. He was cited by the Chinese Society of Ultrasound in Medicine as the “World’s best echocardiographer” and honored by them for introducing the pulsed Doppler technology to China.  In India, he has received in the past the Life Time Achievement Award by the Government of India and more recently “Icon of the Century in Echocardiography and Cardiology in the World” presented by the Government of India through its Ministry of Health and quoted in the current book on Vice-President Kamala Harris. Two Institutes in India have been named after him. The Dr. Navin C. Nanda Institute of Excellence in Cardiovascular Ultrasound was established in Nashik city, Maharashtra and the Dr. Navin C. Nanda Echocardiography, Emergency Medicine and Paramedics Training Institute, established in Jaipur, Rajasthan, where his bust has  been placed at the entrance. In addition, the Navin C. Nanda Young Investigator Award has also been established by the Cardiological Society  of India and is given every year. He has also received “Prince of Echocardiography” Award from Italy, “Citizen of Rome”  award from the Mayor of Rome and the Andreas Gruntzig Award from the Swiss Society of Cardiology. The Government of the United Arab Emirates and the Emirates Cardiac Society honored him as “Echocardiographer of the Millenium” and “Friend of Bangladesh” award was given him by  the Minister of Health. Dr. Nanda was brought into the American Association of Physicians of India by his mentor Dr. Jagan Kakarala as its President-Elect and then as President when the Association was at cross-roads to help unite various factions and was instrumental in helping legally incorporate the Association as well as revising its Constitution and establishing the Board of Trustees. He worked, among others, with Dr. Sudhir Parikh to popularize and advance the aims of the organization and re-establish cordial relations with the American Medical Association. Dr. Nanda also founded the American Association of Cardiologists of Indian Origin which with its much larger membership than AAPI at that time served to boost and strengthen the parent organization. Dr. Nanda together with Dr. Naresh Parikh in Atlanta, Georgia, led a mammoth task of organizing the first ever largescale survey of Asian Indians settled in the USA for the prevalence of various diseases such as stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes and coronary heart disease and found the prevalence of these diseases much higher than in other ethnic groups in U.S. and higher than in Indians living in India. Dr. Nanda also received the Bridge Award from USA’s , Association of Black Cardiologists for “building bridges across cultures, particularly among African American and Asian Indian cardiologists.” His community services have included stints as the President of the Indian Cultural Association of Birmingham, President of the Alabama  Chapter of the Indo-American Forum for Political Education, President of the AlabamaIndia Business Partnership and an award from Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha, Atlanta, Georgia, for “outstanding service to the community”. Dr. Robert Gatewood, one of the eminent Cardiologists he has trained wrote “Over the past 40 years he has been not only my mentor and inspiration but also my good friend and confidant.  His energy is endless and his curiosity contagious.  He continues to explore the boundaries of cardiac ultrasound while steadfastly demanding quality and integrity in his research. Equally important has been his global vision.  Dr. Nanda has encouraged and facilitated cross pollination of ideas and collaboration in research.  His teaching conferences typically include a diverse faculty and audience.  He has brought us together from all corners of the world in the pursuit of knowledge and innovation.  Dr. Nanda will forever stand as a pioneer, a true icon, in the field of echocardiography.  His imprint is indelible. His impact immeasurable.” Dr. Navin Nanda Photo: courtesy Dr. Navin Nanda","@ID":12},{"#text":"www.newsindiatimes.com – that’s all you need to know 3 News India Times September 10, 2021 Opinion Disclaimer: Parikh Worldwide Media assumes no liability for claims/ assumptions made in advertisements and advertorials.

It was hard to find coverage of her trip in U.S. media, which understandably was absorbed in the events in Afghanistan. But in a surprising way, the trip underscored an argument the Biden administration has been advancing: Afghanistan is not our biggest worry. The United States has much more significant national security and economic issues elsewhere, especially in Asia. Indeed, talk of a “pivot to Asia” has been going on for 20 years, but so long as we were spending billions to fight a war that was not really possible to win, past administrations have been unable to focus on China and our Asian alliances, no matter how hard they tried. Harris’s trip was not a certainty. Her first foreign trip outside the Americas could have been to Europe or the Middle East. Instead, she chose Southeast Asia, despite concerns of covid-19. As the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated, State Department sources tell me, the issue came up as to whether she should go. Harris came down strongly in favor. Both in private and in public, officials in Singapore and in Vietnam expressed enthusiasm that she had kept the trip on track. Backing out would have sent the wrong signal that the administration was in retreat or did not care as much about our future relationship with Asia as withdrawing from a 20-year war. Harris could point to a series of meaningful “deliverables” in Vietnam, such as assistance on covid-19, new commitments on green energy, security cooperation and tariff reductions. At a time when U.S. media was comparing the fall of Kabul to the fall of Saigon, this was a reminder that the United States did not continue a futile war in Vietnam endlessly; we moved on, and our influence in the region is stronger than it was in the 1970s. At a news conference in Vietnam, reporters naturally asked Harris about Afghanistan, but nearly the entire event centered on expanding relations with Vietnam on a number of fronts. “I am the first vice president to visit Vietnam since diplomatic relations were established in 1995. And I believe that this trip signals the beginning of the next chapter in the relationship between the United States and Vietnam,” Harris said. This was in stark contrast to the picture that the media painted regarding Afghanistan - that the United States had shaken allies and raised questions about its commitments. She also raised human rights in her discussions with Vietnam. She said she privately pressured officials on political dissidents and highlighted civil society players. “We’re not going to shy away from difficult conversations,” she said at her news conference. NPR reported that on the last day of her trip, she “turned her attention to issues surrounding worker rights and civil liberties . . . elevating activists in a region of the world known for its challenges and restrictions to human rights.” The report continued, “Harris participated in what her team billed as a ‘changemakers’ event with activists working on LGBTQ rights and climate change.” Perhaps reports of our waning interest in human rights are premature - or just wrong. The contrast between agonizing over America’s standing and evidence of our determination to expand it was most evident in Singapore. The remarks from Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the start of a joint news conference were telling: The Biden administration inherited an extremely difficult situation. The U.S. had invested considerable blood and treasure in Afghanistan. But it was an intractable task given the complex history, geography and tribal rivalries of the place. Successive U.S. presidents have declared their resolve to withdraw from Afghanistan. So I told the vice president that we understand President Biden’s reasons for his decision. The U.S. intervention has stopped terrorist groups from using Afghanistan as a safe base for 20 years. For this, Singapore is grateful. We hope Afghanistan does not become an epicenter for terrorism again. And post Afghanistan, in the longer term, what matters is how the U.S. repositions itself in the Asia Pacific, engages the broader region and continues the fight against terrorism because that will determine the perceptions of the countries, of the U.S. global priorities and of its strategic intentions. Well that surely does not jibe with the favored media narrative of a nation shunned by allies. Lee continued, “On this 55th anniversary of U.S.-Singapore diplomatic relations, I’m happy that we are embarking on new areas of partnership. We concluded three agreements between our cyberdefense and finance industries, agencies. Singapore and [the] U.S. are also launching a climate partnership, and we are also pleased with our joint smart city capacity building initiatives.” He praised a new partnership “for growth and innovation” and welcomed dialogue to “strengthen supply chain resilience.” In a speech in Singapore, Harris briefly addressed Afghanistan, but then turned to the meat of her speech. She reiterated commitments on security and then leveled a strong rebuke against China, which she said “continues to coerce, to intimidate and to make claims to the vast majority of the South China Sea.” She emphasized, “These unlawful claims have been rejected by the 2016 arbitral tribunal decision. And Beijing’s actions continue to undermine the rulesbased order and threaten the sovereignty of nations. The United States stands with our allies and partners in the face of these threats.” Harris got strong reviews from foreign policy gurus. Jonathan Stromseth at the Brookings Institution noted: In that speech [in Singapore] she put forward a positive vision of peace and stability, freedom of the seas, unimpeded commerce, advancing human rights - including in places like Burma - and a commitment to the international rulesbased order. … She also addressed the pullout in Afghanistan, indicating that as the U.S. addresses urgent developments there it’s also capable of continuing to advance U.S. interests in other regions like Southeast Asia. Stromseth argued that, “if the Harris visit is followed up by vigorous diplomacy matched with resources, then perhaps the pivot to Asia, or the rebalance policy of the Obama administration, can finally be realized as the U.S. becomes less distracted by these endless wars in the Middle East.” The notion that allies in other parts of the world fear that the United States will abandon ongoing mutual interests because it is shedding military obligations in Afghanistan certainly was not evident in Harris’s meetings with officials in either country. State Department officials said her bilateral meetings went beyond the allotted time and estimated that 95 percent focused on issues at hand and 5 percent on Afghanistan. Unsurprisingly, other countries around the world care about themselves and their regional issues. Harris was there to reaffirm that it is full steam ahead on our relationships with Southeast Asian allies in the face of China’s military, economic and cyber threats. In doing so, she underscored that rather than edging away from U.S. allies, the administration wants to draw them closer. -THE WASHINGTON POST Photo: The Washington Post U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris (L) and Vietnam’s President Nguyen Xuan Phuc pose for a photograph in the Presidential palace in Hanoi August 25, 2021 Manan Vatsyayana/Pool via REUTERS","@ID":3},{"#text":"17 News India Times September 10, 2021 Employment-Based Immigration Doubles Come October 1st NPZ Law Group, PC Tel: 201-670-0006 x 107 Toll Free: 866-599-3625 www.visaserve.com Immigration October 1st, 2021, will mark the new government fiscal year. Therefore, this year will be great for immigrant professionals seeking employment-based visas. The number of visas will double from 140,000 persons annually to 290,000 in the following fiscal year. This is due to the backlog of applications by relatives of green card holders or US citizens because US embassies were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s an update of this change from the NPZ Law Group.: Who Benefits from Doubling Employment-Based Immigration: Thousands of health care professionals and computer programmers waiting for green cards are sponsored by US employers every year. Due to the pandemic, US hospitals are dealing with a significant shortage of nurses, doctors, and other healthcare professionals. This explanation will help elucidate that. The EB-3 employment-based immigration category for most immigrant professionals acquiring green cards is “current.” Thus, the waiting period is as long as the time the government takes to process the paperwork for the professional. For registered nurses (RNs), the process begins when a US employer files a Form I-140 visa petition with the USCIS. The employer can use premium processing to approve the visa petition in weeks instead of months. The USCIS then forwards the approved petition to theNational VisaCenter (NVC) in New England. The nurse must provide various pieces of information to the NVC. The NVC then coordinates with the US Consulate/Embassy in the RN’s home country to schedule the nurse, his/her spouse, and children, for green card interviews. The nurse and his/her family can seek admission to the US after the green card applications are approved. The PERMApplication: The US Department of Labor (DOL) designates registered nurses as a shortage p r o f e s s i o n . Therefore, the employer need not prove that there are no able, willing and qualified US workers for the position. However, the employer must do so for most other jobs, which is called the PERM Labor Certification process. The PERM process (labor certification) ensures that the admission of immigrant workers to work in the US will not adversely affect US workers’ job opportunities, working conditions, and wages. The DOL will only approve the PERM application after a US employer demonstrates that these are no qualified US workers who have applied for the position and that the employer pays the prevailing wage. Typically, this process can take 7 to 10 months. The employer must submit an I-140 visa petition to the USCIS after approval of the PERM application. What This Means for US Employers: Most immigrant professionals sponsored for green cards by US employers have temporary work visas and work in the US currently. They can then bypass the NVC and the US Embassy, allowing them to apply for adjustment of status to acquire Michael Phulwani David Nachman Ludka Zimovcak Snehal Batra In Memoriam By David H. Nachman, Esq their green cards without leaving the US. However, RNs must give interviews at US Consulates/Embassies in their home countries because there are no temporary work visas for acquiring green cards for that position.

More than 480 million people living in the vast swathes of central, eastern and northern India, including the capital, New Delhi, endure significantly high pollution levels, said the report prepared by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC). “Alarmingly, India’s high levels of air pollution have expanded geographically over time,” the EPIC report said. For example, air quality has significantly worsened in the western state of Maharashtra and the central state of Madhya Pradesh, it said. Lauding India’s National Clean Air Program (NCAP), launched in 2019 to rein in dangerous pollution levels, the EPIC report said “achieving and sustaining” the NCAP goals would raise the country’s overall life expectancy by 1.7 years and that of New Delhi 3.1 years. The NCAP aims to reduce pollution in the 102 worst-affected cities by 20%-30% by 2024 by ensuring cuts in industrial emissions and vehicular exhaust, introducing stringent rules for transport fuels and biomass burning and reduce dust pollution. It will also entail better monitoring systems. (https://reut. rs/3sZXYTE) New Delhi was the world’s most polluted capital for the third straight year in 2020, according to IQAir, a Swiss group that measures air quality levels based on the concentration of lung-damaging airborne particles known as PM2.5. Last year, New Delhi’s 20 million residents, who breathed some of the cleanest air on record in the summer because of coronavirus lockdown curbs, battled toxic air in winter following a sharp increase in farm residue burning in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana. According to the EPIC’s findings, neighbouring Bangladesh could raise average life expectancy by 5.4 years if the country improves air quality to levels recommended by the World Health Organization. To arrive at the life expectancy number, EPIC compared the health of people exposed to different levels of long-term air pollution and applied the results to various places in India and elsewhere.

The Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave the approval to the Hyderabadbased pharmaceutical company on Sept. 1, the statement https://pib. gov.in/PressReleseDetail. aspx?PRID=1751664 said. The company will study the safety and tolerability of its vaccine, CORBEVAX, in this population, it added. So far, six vaccines have been authorized for use in the country where only about 11.28% of the entire population has been fully vaccinated so far, according to Johns Hopkins data https:// coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/ india. Of these, the COVID-19 shots for adults by Bharat Biotech and Zydus Cadila have been indigenously developed. In late August, India also approved Cadila’s COVID-19 vaccine, the world’s first DNA shot against the coronavirus, for emergency use in children aged 12 years and above. Biological E. is also running a late-stage trial of its vaccine in adults. BY REUTERS By Gerry Shih NEW DELHI Syed Ali Shah Geelani, a leader of Kashmir’s separatist movement who vexed the New Delhi government for decades with his uncompromising politics, died Wednesday night (Sept. 1, 2021), prompting Indian authorities to deploy troops around the restive region and cut Internet access. Geelani, who had been struggling with kidney disease and dementia, died at his home in Srinagar, where he had been under house arrest for years, said his son Naseem Geelani and Syed Omar, a family caretaker. He was 91. After word of Geelani’s death spread, local police sealed his street and whisked away his body in the early hours of Thursdaymorning. Geelani was not permitted to be buried at themartyr’s graveyard, but was hastily interred at a local cemetery before sunrise and under close police watch, according to the family. By early Thursday, rows of local shops remained closed on city streets patrolled by paramilitary troops, while cellphone service and roads between cities were cut off to private cars, according to local residents. Indian authorities often cut Internet access in Kashmir to forestall publicThe sensitivity around Geelani’s death reflects the enduring tensions in Indian-administered Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region that has bristled under New Delhi’s rule and lies at the heart of the explosive territorial dispute between India and Pakistan that has been unresolved since the 1947 Partition of India. Both countries control parts of the region but claim its entirety, and they have fought two wars and countless other proxy battles over it. Geelani, who favored Kashmir’s accession to Pakistan, became the face of secessionists, especially in the latter decades of his life. He led vast strikes and shutdowns that forced the region to a standstill and led protests against the Indian military presence and their alleged crimes against local civilians. Revered in Kashmir, supported in Pakistan and reviled in India, he was elected to Jammu and Kashmir’s legislative assembly in 1972, 1977 and 1987, served lengthy prison sentences and was charged with nearly 60 counts of political crimes over five decades in politics. In the 1990s, as Kashmir became gripped by violent insurgency, Geelani helped found the Hurriyat Conference, an amalgamation of groups seeking autonomy in Kashmir. When the front’s more moderate leaders advocated dialogue with the New Delhi government, he splintered off and continued to advocate a rigid stance that garnered adulation from a younger generation of Kashmiris but flustered his more pragmatic peers. In 2001, Geelani was a rare public voice who objected to a proposal made by Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to withdraw both Indian and Pakistani troops from Kashmir and loosen border controls. The attempt at a peace deal won approval frommany Kashmiri leaders but not Geelani, who denounced it as a diplomatic “trick” between two countries. The proposal ultimately fell apart. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced Pakistan would observe a day of mourning. “We in Pakistan salute his courageous struggle and remember his words: ‘Hum Pakistani hain aur Pakistan Humara hai,’ “ Khan said Thursday on Twitter. The quote translates to: “We are Pakistani and Pakistan is ours.” Meanwhile in Indian-administered Kashmir, the region’s police chief, Vijay Kumar, urged Geelani’s supporters to refrain from gathering at his home and said the Internet would be cut and a curfew enforced. Local media organizations were also forbidden from publishing, said Tahir Bhat, an editor at Kashmir Life. Bashir Ahmad, a public school teacher in Kupwara near the Line of Control that separates Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir, said police on the Indian side were not allowing cars to enter towns. When reached by telephone on Thursday, Naseem Geelani, 52, said the police had pushed the family to bury his father before dawn to prevent a breakdown in law and order. “It was not an honorable way to treat him,” said Geelani, a professor in Srinagar who has been repeatedly probed by Indian investigators for suspected ties to Pakistan-based terrorist groups but never charged. Indian officials fear Geelani’s death could provoke a response similar to that of Burhan Wani, a militant leader - and social media star - whose death in a July 2016 gunfight with Indian troops sparked a wave of violent protests across Kashmir that led to dozens of deaths and did not subside for months. Geelani was under house arrest during those months but continued to rally supporters by phone. India shuts down Internet access in the name of public security more often than any other country in the world. In 2020, India accounted for 155 instances of intentional Internet disruptions, followed by Yemen, at six, according to the digital rights group Access Now. Kashmir was again put under a lengthy lockdown without Internet access in 2019, when the Indian parliament revoked the region’s longstanding semiautonomous status in a move that Indian officials said would bring greater stability and integration with the rest of the country.

Affairs By a Staff Writer Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Affairs Dr. Ely Ratner co-chaired the fifth U.S. – India 2+2 Intercessional Dialogue, Sept. 1, 2021, along with Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Ervin Massinga. The co-chairs on the Indian side were Joint Secretary Somnath Ghosh of the Indian Ministry of Defense, and Joint Secretary Vani Rao of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The Dialogue spanned the U.S.- India comprehensive global strategic partnership, including climate, public health, defense, trade, technology and governance, a Sept. 2, 2021, press release from DOD said. Assistant Secretary Ratner expressed his confidence that the United States and India will continue to take their partnership to new heights as they jointly meet the challenges of this century, the press release said. During the high-level meeting, officials exchanged views on a range of regional issues of shared interest, including in South Asia, East and Southeast Asia, and the Western Indian Ocean. They identified opportunities for enhanced cooperation on maritime security, regional connectivity, counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, DOD said. In the backdrop of several defense cooperation agreements in place, officials committed to driving greater interoperability between the U.S. and Indian militaries. They also discussed bilateral and multilateral joint service engagements, as well as ways to advance cooperation in new domains, such as space, cyber, and emerging technology areas. Discussions also covered operationalizing existing key bilateral initiatives on information-sharing, logistics, defense industrial cooperation, and joint doctrine engagement through liaison exchanges. Building on growing bilateral ties, U.S. and Indian officials discussed new opportunities to strengthen multilateral cooperation between the United States, India, and other like-minded partners, DOD said. “Today’s Intercessional laid the groundwork for a fruitful 2+2 Ministerial Dialogue in the coming months, as the United States and India work together to sustain a free, open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,” the press release said.  . By a Staff Writer As the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan winds down, U.S. and Indian officials are meeting on a regular basis at various levels to discuss the repercussions, and advance their strategic partnership. India’s Foreign Secretary Harsh V. Shringla met U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken Sept. 2, 2021, as well as Deputy Secretary Wendy Sherman. “Excellent interaction this morning with secretary of State @SecBlinken & @DeputySecState Wendy Serman!” tweeted India’s Ambassador to the U.S. Taranjit Singh Sandhu. According to tweets from India’s Ministry of External Affairs, discussions touched on bilateral ties and the situation in Afghanistan. They also reviewed developments in the Indo-Pacific region, Covid-19 pandemic, and discussed cooperation in the United Nations and other regional and multilateral issues of mutual interest, the MEA tweeted. Foreign Secretary Shringla’s discussion with Deputy Secretary Sherman were “substantive” and dealt with advancing the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership across sectors from healthcare to defense, climate change and people-to-people ties, the MEA said. By a Staff Writer A federal grand jury charged two men from Cincinnati, Ohio, with a string of armed robberies and the February 2021 murder of Roop C. Gupta, the owner of Madeira Beverage. Willie James Attaway, 30, of Cincinnati, and Lamond Johnson, 35, most recently of Cincinnati, are charged by  a 14-count indictment. An indictment is merely an allegation, and defendants are presumed innocent unless proven guilty in a court of law.. According to the charging document, Attaway and Johnson allegedly conspired to commit five armed robberies on Feb. 8 and 9, 2021. Vipal J. Patel, Acting United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, and Roland Herndon, Special Agent in Charge, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives (ATF), announced the charges. According to a Sept. 2, 2021, press release from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, specifically, the defendants allegedly brandished a firearm to commit robberies on the following occasions: February 8 – Shell on Montgomery Road in Deerfield Township, February 8 – Shell on Dixie Highway in Hamilton, Ohio, February 9 – Madeira Beverage on Kenwood Road in Madeira, Ohio, February 9 – Sunoco on Kenwood Road in Blue Ash, Ohio, and February 9 – Marathon on North Broadway in Lebanon, Ohio. Attaway and Johnson are both charged with the Feb. 9, 2021 murder of Gupta, the owner of Madeira Beverage. Using a firearm to commit murder during a crime of violence is potentially punishable by the death penalty, the press release noted. Related local charges pending against Johnson will be superseded by the federal indictment returned yesterday, and the case will proceed federally, the press release added. Attaway and Johnson appeared in federal court Sept. 2, at 1:30pm and the indictment was unsealed at that time.

Unfortunately, the 40-year-old actor embarked on his final journey on Thursday, leaving everyone in a state of grief. Born on December 12 1980 in Mumbai, Sidharth, who held a degree in interior designing, chose to switch gears to the modelling field, where he clinched the runner-up position in Gladrags Manhunt and Megamodel Contest in 2004. The modelling stint was followed by his first appearance in a music video titled ‘Resham Ka Rumal’, which was sung by Ila Arun. In 2005, he made Indians proud by winning the World’s Best Model contest held in Turkey. After winning the title, he bagged a few advertisements for some leading brands. Following his successful modelling days, the actor moved to leave a spark in the TV industry with his first acting role in ‘Babul Ka Aangann Chootey Na’ (2008). He later starred in shows such as ‘Jaane Pehchaane Se… Ye Ajnabbi’ and ‘Love U Zindagi’, which also featured Pavitra Punia. He also appeared in an episode of CID and a few episodes of ‘Aahat’. However, it was his role as district collector Shivraj Shekhar in ‘Balika Vadhu’ that earned him widespread acclaim and popularity, including several awards and nominations. His acting skills caught the attention of many leading film production houses and he finally landed a role in Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions’ movie ‘Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania’, which starred Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan in the lead roles. Sidharth played the role of Angad Bedi, an NRI doctor and fiance of Alia’s character. The film earned him an award for Breakthrough Supporting Performance (Male) in the 2015 Stardust Awards. Apart from showing off his acting talent in daily soaps, Sidharth unleashed his adventurous side by participating in the popular reality show ‘Khatron Ke Khiladi 7’, which he also won. Viewers also got to see dancing skills in ‘Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 6’, however, he was eliminated in the 11th week of the show. He also had some hosting gigs under his belt. Sidharth hosted a few seasons of the famous reality show ‘India’s Got Talent’ alongside comedian Bharti Singh. In 2017, he returned as a leading star in TV shows with Colors’ serial ‘Dil Se Dil Tak’, co-starring Rashami Desai and Jasmin Bhasin. The series was inspired by the Bollywood movie, ‘Chori Chori Chupke Chupke’. However, he left the show in between due to unknown reasons. The best phase of his career started in 2020 with the hit reality show ‘Bigg Boss 13’ that amassed him a fan following like never before. His angry young man avatar, his clashes with co-contestants including Asim Riaz, Rashami Desai, and friendship with Shehnaaz Gill stole the limelight and made him win the show. After featuring in ‘Bigg Boss 13’, his career got a new boom. He then treated fans with his appearance in three music videos back to back: Darshan Rawal’s ‘Bhula Dunga’ (March 2020), Neha Kakkar and Yasser Desai’s ‘Dil Ko Karaar Aaya’ (July 2020) and Tony Kakkar’s ‘Shona Shona’ (November 2020). In the same year, Bigg Boss lovers got a chance to see him in the house again but as a ‘Toofani Senior’ alongside Hina Khan and Gauahar Khan. He was seen boosting the morale of the participants in the show. Sidharth made his digital debut as Agastya Rao in the third season of the romance web series ‘Broken But Beautiful’ opposite Sonia Rathee. The actor’s last appearance on-screen was with Shehnaaz Gill on this year’s ‘Bigg Boss OTT’ and ‘Dance Deewane 3’. Apart from his work, Sidharth was also in the spotlight for his personal life, especially, for his equation with Shehnaaz Gill. Reportedly, he had also been linked with many other actors including Rashami Desai, Arti Singh, and Pavitra Punia. Sidharth is survived by his mother and two sisters, with whom the late star shared a special bond. The actor had time and again expressed his love for his doting mother on social media. -ANI The popular television show, ‘Pavitra Rishta’ is all set to return with its second season ‘Pavitra Rishta – It’s never too late’, in which Ankita Lokhande is reprising the role of Archana and Shaheer Sheikh is stepping into the shoes of Manav’s character earlier played by late actor Sushant Singh Rajput. The makers of the show, on Wednesday, released the trailer along with the premiere date — September 15. The 8-part web series created by Ekta R Kapoor will stream on OTT platform ZEE5. Sharing her excitement for the show, Ankita said, “Rarely does one do a role or a project which transforms their lives completely. Pavitra Rishta was that project for me as the love I received from the audience for Archana’s character was unparalleled. So, how could I turn down the opportunity to reprise the role and continue the legacy of Archana? I am so grateful to Ekta and ZEE for reviving Pavitra Rishta and for having faith in me again. I am eager to see the audience’s reaction to Archuu all over again”. As seen in the trailer, the series is a romantic family drama centred around Manav and Archana. The two are set up by their families for an arranged marriage and they fall in love at first sight. To ensure the union, Manav’s family lies about their financial situation. Things begin to crumble once the reality comes out, challenging Archana and Manav’s love for each other. Ekta R Kapoor, Joint Managing Director of Balaji Telefilms Limited, shared, “Some shows and characters leave a big impression on you for years to come. ‘Pavitra Rishta’ was one such show which impacted so many lives and received so much love and good wishes from fans across the world. There could not have been a better timing to bring back the show and honour the legacy of it. I am sure that the fans will give it as much as love and acceptance as they did to the first season”. The show first aired in 2009 on Zee TV, in which late actor Sushant Singh Rajput essayed the role of Manav. Addressing Manav as his “most pure character”, Shaheer Sheikh shared, “It has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me – from the time I was offered the role to eventually being on set and shooting with this amazing unit. It’s been a challenging role to essay, but I have given it my all. In the process of shooting the show, I realised that ‘Manav’ is the most earnest and pure character I’ve ever played and in today’s day and age, such a character is a rarity! Now I only hope that our efforts resonate with the audiences”. Directed by Nandita Mehra and written by Nikita Dhond, Gautam Hegde and Ritu Bhatia, the show is produced by Bhairavi Raichura’s 24 Frames Production. -ANI Bollywood actor and model Sidharth Shukla. Ankita Lokhande, star of TV series ‘Pavitra Rishta’ Twitter @sidharth_shukla Photo: Twitter @anky1912 Popular dance reality show ‘Dance+’ is returning with an all-new season 6, exclusively on Disney+ Hotstar on September 14. The show will witness once again choreographer and director Remo D’ Souza as the Super Judge and Raghav Juyal as the host. This time, episodes will be aired every day, and the show is set to become the first Indian dance reality show to premiere on a digital streaming platform before television. Apart from the contestants, Remo will once again be seen judging three of his dance proteges — Salman Yusuf Khan, Shakti Mohan and Punit Pathak, for their mentorship skills and captaincy. Talking about his return with ‘Dance+’ Season 6, Remo D’ Souza said, “After the past two years, I find myself even more passionate about the craft of dancing. I am glad to make a comeback as the super judge on ‘Dance+’, the biggest dance reality show. This opportunity gives me a scope to share my knowledge of dance, something I dearly love and have built my life on. I know this season will be packed with many mindblowing performances because Shakti, Salman and Punit are fantastic dancers themselves. What makes this season even more special is the fact that it’s premiering this September on Disney+ Hotstar first, ahead of TV, and viewers getting the chance to enjoy uninterrupted entertainment that we bring them.” Returning captain Punit J. Pathak already has two wins across the previously aired five seasons. Expressing his excitement for the new season, Punit said, “I have been waiting for the return of ‘Dance+’ ever since the last season ended. This season’s exclusive premiere on a platform like Disney+ Hotstar has me thrilled and excited. Mentoring talented individuals and innovating on new techniques on this show has almost been like going back to dance school. What makes this season more memorable is that my two friends – Shakti, will be returning as a captain along with the new captain, Salman, whose journey I’ve been following since the start.” Season 6 of ‘Dance+’ gets bigger with the introduction of an all-new feature that takes the competition several notches higher; the captains and Super Judge can deep-dive and further evaluate performances from the lens of the Super Cam (SCAM). -ANI ‘Dance+’ Season 6 To Start Streaming From September 14","@ID":19},{"#text":"Thanks to its size, the United States is one of the best places in the world to appreciate fall foliage. New England tends to get most of the attention during the season, but there are far more places to see autumnal splendor. To pinpoint some highlights, we talked to travel experts about their favorite destinations for fall trips. Beyond their specific places to visit, they all had a word of warning for travelers. “For anyone thinking about traveling these days: Book early because space continues to be limited,” said Erina Pindar, managing director at the luxury travel agency SmartFlyer. “Plan ahead.” While Pindar’s advice has been pertinent for travel year-round, Richard Engle, travel adviser with Global Travel Collection’s BookHuman.Travel, said fall may be particularly tricky. “Earlier in the year, people were pretty convinced they were not going to be able to go abroad, so many people have made reservations for fall trips already,” Engle said. “For many places, you could be too late.” Once you (quickly) decide where to go, you will want to refer to the 2021 fall foliage tracker to determine when to visit. For the uninitiated, the map can help travelers estimate when parts of the U.S. will reach its peak-fall colors. It’s not a perfect science, but it has the potential for giving you a better shot at seeing autumn’s finest. Here’s where to start your trip brainstorming. Virginia For a multicolor fall experience, Engle sends travelers to Virginia to see “the beautiful scenery of the Appalachians.” Other highlights are the Shenandoah Valley, Grayson Highlands State Park and the Priest Wilderness, a 5,726-acre hiker’s paradise in southwestern Virginia. The state is particularly appealing to active travelers, “because there are all kinds of hiking trails, cycling trails in those areas,” Engle said. “The horseback riding is really fun.” The Virginia tourism board put together its own fall foliage report based on the 2021 fall foliage map that you can to refer to when planning your visit. Vermont Out of all the traditional places in New England to leaf peep, Maya George, founder of Our Black Passports and a luxury travel adviser for Tzell Travel Group, is the biggest fan of Vermont. She recommended staying in Stowe, where there seems to be something for every kind of traveler. “There are a lot of activities to do in Vermont,” she said, listing ideas such as hiking, craft-beer tasting, zip-lining, skiing, backpacking, mountain biking, dining and hot-air-balloon riding. On the luxury front, Pindar points travelers to Twin Farms, a farmhouse turned adults-only, all-inclusive resort and spa located 90 minutes from Burlington in Barnard. “There it’s pretty epic in terms of fall foliage,” she said of the property, which was previously owned by Nobel Prize-winning author Sinclair Lewis. Colorado Another Engle favorite is his home state, Colorado, where fall transforms the state into a gilded dream. “InAspen and Telluride, we have amazing golden colors when the aspens turn,” he said. “Since there’s so many of them, you can have whole mountains full of gold.” For the active set, Engle also recommended visiting Steamboat Springs. New York New York state offers the best of both worlds for fall travelers. On the one hand, you have one of the most vibrant cities in the world. And on the other, there are plentiful options for rural retreats upstate. George says New York City is her first choice, always, for fall trips. A New York native, George sends people to the city’s parks, including Central Park (obviously) in Manhattan and Prospect Park in Brooklyn, as well as the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Pindar recommended driving north to Kingston to stay at Hutton Brickyards, a boutique hotel on 73 acres located near Storm King Art Center in New Windsor (where you need tickets for a timed reservation). Illinois For another trip that combines the best of city living and more rural adventures, Engle points fall travelers to Illinois. He suggested anchoring your trip in Chicago where “there are all the same beautiful trees and beautiful colors in there, but then you have the whole city thing, too,” he said. Additionally, Chicago will have more accommodation availability than the charming bed-and-breakfasts or resorts in more popular leaf-peeping destinations nearby. “You can take day trips in a car into Wisconsin and it’s a whole new world, or into Michigan and it’s a whole new world,” Engle said. “And you can still come back to the city and sleep.” Maine George sends families and campers to Maine for its parks, nature reserves, coastal roads and lakes. She recommended starting a trip in a city like Portland or Bath, then driving farther north to explore the state’s outdoor wonders. Some highlights include the 66-acre Merryspring Nature Center in Camden, Acadia National Park (you can buy your entrance pass digitally ahead of your visit) and Maine Public Lands for camping and hiking. North Carolina Pindar grew up in North Carolina, and she is a fan of recommending clients to the state for fall vacations. “It’s the easy ability to find hiking trails, it’s got cute mountain towns,” she said. “It’s really accessible.” One of her top picks for the area is the Old Edwards Inn and Spa in the southwestern plateau of North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains. Pindar said guests will enjoy the town of Highlands, as well as its proximity to Asheville. “It’s just so beautiful in the fall,” she said of the region. “It’s a classic.” Tennessee Tennessee is a popular fall trip choice for Engle and Pindar. In fact, Pindar said the luxury hotel and resort Blackberry Farm in Walland is “easily one of the most requested properties for our team.” However, Engle noted, “most of the best places are sold out already for the fall,” including Blackberry. But it’s not one particular resort that makes Tennessee so special in the fall; it’s the grandeur of the Great Smoky Mountains. Travelers can hunt for other accommodations in the region, from vacation rental homes, cabins and glamping tents. 11 News India Times September 10, 2021 Leaf-peeping season is coming.

By Sirshendu Panth India’s Tokyo Olympics gold medalist javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra virtually reemphasized the Olympic Charter when he berated those using his name and twisting his comments to foment anti-Pakistan propaganda and promote their “dirty agenda”. Demonstrating the spunk that has made him a world champion in his sport, the farmer’s son from Haryana gave lessons in sportsmanship to those assailing Pakistani javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem on social media and television channels.“Sports teaches us to be together and united,” said India’s latest sporting hero, adding that he was “extremely disappointed to see some of the reactions from the (Indian) public”. Chopra’s comments highlighted the spirit of sportsmanship went far beyond the animosities andmutual demonization induced by political factors,  which have left India and Pakistan endlessly bickering for decades, causing much bloodshed, drain of finances due to defense and security considerations, and prevented healthy people-to-people contact between two neighbors with a shared history and culture. The social media outbursts targeting Nadeem, who has repeatedly said that he idolizes Chopra, began after the Indian athlete told Times of India that he attempted his first throw at the Olympic finals hurriedly as the Pakistani competitor was “moving around” with his javelin. Though Chopra had commented casually, it was soon picked up by news channels and hawks active on social media. They smelled a “Pakistani conspiracy” and accused Nadeem of “tampering with”, “stealing” the Indian’s javelin, and keeping the spear with himself so that Chopra ran out of time for his throws. As the hate messages continued to pour in a toxic social media, Chopra sprung to Nadeem’s defense. He explained that all throwers kept their javelin together, and it was no big deal that the Pakistani was moving with his javelin, and returned it immediately when he requested. “There was nothing wrong with Arshad Nadeem using my javelin to prepare; it is within rules and please do not use my name to push a dirty agenda,” he told The Wire, an Indian website. The Fundamental Principles of Olympism, part of the Olympic Charter,  lays down that the “goal of Olympism is to place sport at the service of the harmonious development of humankind, to promote a peaceful society concerned with the preservation of human dignity”.  Chopra has aptly conformed to this spirit in his bid to protect fellow sportsman Nadeem’s dignity while bringing out mutual respect among athletes, irrespective of their intense rivalries, for sporting glory. SUPPORT FROM SPORTSPERSONS After Chopra’s forthright comments, other leading Indian sportspersons like Tokyo medalist and wrestler Bajrang Punia, Rio Olympics bronze winner Sakshi Malik, veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal and golfer Jeev Milkha Singh strongly endorsed his sentiments about the syncretism that sports achieve and against the fomenting of IndiaPakistan hatred in the sporting arena. Jeev Milkha, in a signed article for Indian Express, called Chopra “a true champion” for the way he supported Nadeem and remembered the friendships he struck during his many trips to Pakistan with celebrated Pakistani golfers like Taimur Hassan Amin. He also recalled the love and respect his father – India’s legendary quartermiler Milkha Singh, who finished fourth in the Rome Olympics (1960) – got in Pakistan as an athlete, despite having had to flee from that country as a child during the 1947 partition. In fact, the name Flying Sikh – by which Milkha is fondly called for his lightning runs – was given by Pakistan’s military dictator Field Marshal Ayub Khan after the former’s famous run. After winning the 200 metre International Athletic Competition in Lahore against his Pakistani rival Abdul Khaliq, General Ayub Khan had said to Milkha Singh that he did not run in Pakistan but flew instead, and gave him the sobriquet “Flying Sikh”.  While it’s true that some sportspersons – like star cricketers Gautam Gambhir and Virender Sehwag on the Indian side and Pakistan’s Javed Miandad - have through their social media posts or aggressive comments on television channels often, wittingly or unwittingly,  pandered to the hawks in both nations and their hate agenda,  there is also a section of players who have wondered aloud why sportspersons should fight each other away from the sporting arena, going against the very spirit of sports.   Two years back, Pakistan’s former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar quizzed another cricketing great Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on the issue.  “What happens to us cricketers on television? When we are at some news channel, why are there such differences?” asked the man, called the “Rawalpindi Express”, on his YouTube channel.  “Political context should be kept separate. But I have always said that my cricketing heroes are from India, from Pakistan. Even from Australia,’ responded Harbhajan Singh, who is known by his nickname “Bhaji”. But Akhtar wanted a more categoric reply.  “A part of it is because of the media,” said Harbhajan, the world’s secondhighest wicket-taker off-spinner. “A simple match is scandalized like anything. It should be fun. Two countries come together, sit with each other. We look so similar, we speak like one another, enjoy the match together.” CRICKET AND TWO WORLD CUPS A look back down the years brings out instances of close bonding between players and sports organizers of the two countries, with the relationships at times going beyond the sports field into the personal domain. Themarriage between Indian tennis star SaniaMirza and top Pakistani cricketer ShoaibMalik is a prime example. The biggest collaboration between the two countries in terms of organizing sporting events happened in cricket – where India and Pakistan collaborated to jointly host the World Cup in 1987 and 1996- Sri Lanka being a co-host in the latter instance. Though cricketing clashes between the two neighbors have been regularly interrupted for years at stretch following wars and militancy, both the World Cups played significant roles in altering the power structure in the game. The 1987 edition broke England’s monopoly over hosting the prized tournament and proved to the world the subcontinent’s ability to organize such events seamlessly, backed by its legions of cricket fans, the huge television audience and big corporates. The 1996 World Cup shifted the epicenter of cricket to the subcontinent, firmly and decisively. When the Indian Premier League – the world’s richest twenty20 tournament – began in 2008, Pakistani stars had participated in good numbers in the early years of the tourney. Among the big names seen in the IPL were Shahid Afridi, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Shoaib Akhtar, Salman Butt and Younis Khan. HOCKEY, FOOTBALL In hockey, a game where the two countries have been traditionally strong, 15 top Pakistan players including the legendary Sohail Abbas, signed in the inaugural edition of the Hockey India League in 2012. However, recurrent political and diplomatic disputes have resulted in neither country in recent years allowing their players to participate in such marquee tournaments organized by the other nation’s sports bodies. Football is another sport which has a big following in the two countries, particularly in India. In the early postpartition years, several footballers from Pakistan plied their trade for Kolkata soccer giants East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting. Particular mention may be made about Masood Fakhri, a professional footballer, who turned out for East Bengal from 1953 to 1955 and then donned the Mohammedan Sporting jersey for the next two years. A talented forward, he played as a left-winger and helped both clubs win several top-rated tournaments. Rupak Saha, in his Bengali book Itihase East Bengal  (East Bengal in History), detailed some interesting happenings about Fakhri and another Pakistani player Niyazi. In those days, things were a bit relaxed, and the Pakistani players used to play in India without taking international clearance from their sports association. In 1953, when the two footballers were part of East Bengal, the Indian Football Association demanded the club produce the international transfer papers of the two players. East Bengal, which had entered the IFA Shield final, failed to comply. As a result, East Bengal was placed under suspension. East Bengal moved court against the decision, but following an out-of-court settlement, the suspension was revoked. East Bengal was, however, adjudged runners-up. Incidentally, the final had remained drawn despite two play-offs. INDO-PAK EXPRESS While all these instances given so far relate to the past, a recent example of the two nation’s sports bonhomie is provided by the “Indo-Pak Express” – comprising tennis stars Pakistan’s Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and India’s Rohan Bopanna, who have been playing together in men’s doubles circuit off and on since 2003. They have bagged five ATP doubles titles together, and also reached the 2010 US Open final. They parted ways in 2010, reunited in 2014, but decided to go their separate ways that year itself. But in 2021, they joined forces in March, albeit for a week. But apart from their on-court success, what distinguishes the pair is their championing of the ‘Stop War, Start Tennis’ slogan, promoting peace in South Asia and calling for the decoupling of sports and politics None can deny the problems and the deep distrust that exists between the two countries – particularly related to themilitary, political and intelligence establishments. Each blames the other for terror incidents on its soil. Amid the thorny political and diplomatic issues, sports can act as themuch-needed balm to remove distrust and promote understanding between India and Pakistan. Unfortunately, sports has become a prisoner to political and diplomatic disputes.

Chaired by, Dr. Satheesh Kathula, members of the committee overseeing the project include President of AAPI Dr. Anupama Gotimukula, Dr. Jagan Ailinani and Dr. Ram Singh. Ambassador of India to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, lauded the numerous efforts of AAPI in India, especially during the pandemic. India’s Consuls General of Chicago, New York, Houston, Atlanta and the Deputy Consul General of San Francisco participated live during the launch of the initiative. “A lot of effort is being put into this initiative, “Adopt a Village” Project where AAPI in collaboration with Global TeleClinics, Inc.,(GTC) plans to adopt 75 villages in honor of 75 years of India’s independence,” she said, according to a press release from AAPI,” Dr. Gotimukula said, according to a press release from AAPI. The 75 villages in India selected for the project are in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, where free health screenings will be conducted and results analyzed by GTC for follow up. “This is a small contribution from AAPI to Mother India in celebration of Azadi Ka  Amrut Mahotsav.” Dr. Gotimukula added. Ambassador Sandhu thanked AAPI and its members, saying, “As India is entering the 75th year of independence, honoring men and women, who fought for the freedom, we rededicate ourselves to build an India where the dreams and aspirations of India’s 13 billion people are realized.” He urged Indians abroad to join in the year-long celebrations. Dr. Kathula noted that three out of four Indians and about 77 percent of the poor live in villages, and a majority has no access to safe drinking water and sanitation. “By adopting one village at a time and working with the government and NGOs, NRIs can make a difference,” said Dr. Kathula. President-Elect of AAPI, Dr. Ravi Kolli, noted India’s progress using life expectancy as a measure, but stressed the need for primary care at the local level, calling for the building of a Family Medicine corps which could deliver accessible and affordable preventive and primary care to the poor. Dr. Ailinani, who was instrumental in founding the program and set an example by adopting his own birth village in Telangana, said, “A majority of the NRI’s hail from villages and would like to do their part to bring progress to villages in our state and country.” Dr. Ram Singh said “There is a real will and desire on the part of governments, both at the state and the center to work with NRIs and NGOs to bring development to rural India.” Dr. KusumPunjabi, chair of AAPI Board of Trustees, thanked AAPImembers who have committed to adopting a village as these kinds of projects and programs require consistency in funding tomake themsustainable. Consul General of India in Houston, AseemMahajan, in his address on “Indo-US Relationship In Healthcare -Rural Health Perspective” praised AAPI members calling them “heroes and partners” especially during Covid. “We can work together, collaborating and sharing of knowledge and expertise, including Medical Education,” he told AAPI. Dr.  Suresh Reddy, past President of AAPI and currently an elected Trustee of Oakbrook Village in Illinois, announced that he is adopting his native village in the state of Telengana. Consul General Kumar spoke about “Rural Health In India, The Current Situation,” and focused on technological areas in healthcare development in the rural parts of India. Consul General of India in Atlanta Dr. Swati Kulkarni focused on “How AAPI and Doctors can Help India.” Dr. Kulkarni said where “India needs overseas expertise, and you are best suited to offer,” it. She pointed to India’s rapidly growing healthcare industry and medical tourism. Consul General in New York, Randhir Jaiswal, focused on “Rural Health in India: The Challenges and Solutions” reiterated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call to rebuild a new India. In light of that, “AAPI’s initiative is even more meaningful and fits well into PM’s vision for India,” CG Jaiswal said. San Francisco Deputy Consul General Rajesh Naik also spoke, as did other AAPI members including, Dr. Sujeeth Punnam, a renowned cardiologist; Dr. Anjana Samadder, vice president of AAPI; Dr. Krishan Kumar, treasurer of AAPI; and Dr. Lokesh Edara, chair for AAPI’s global initiative.

Chief Minister of Tripura, India Biplab Kumar Deb commended Founder and President of Spindle India, Inc, Purnima Nath, for her initiative. Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Danial Kelly said he and his wife were “enchanted with the beauty with which we were surrounded, the aromas of your incomparable cuisine, and the unmatched welcome we received throughout the day.” The blessings of freedom should never be taken for granted, Justice Kelly said, adding that America’s culture is far richer because of the contributions of Indians who call Wisconsin home. Mayor of Milwaukee Tom Barrett proclaimed India Day on Aug 15 noting Nath’s hard work in securing a proclamation, and organizing IndiaFest as did State Senator Chris Larson. Regional Director Paul Truess fromthe office of U.S. Senator Ron Johnson handed a Certificate of Special Senatorial Recognition to Spindle India, Inc., commending the organization for continued dedication, and efforts to bring visibility to the Indian community inWisconsin.

A parade was led by Dhol and the American youth army followed by guests and children cheering “Vande Mataram”, “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, “God Bless America” while waving both Indian and U.S. flags.

August 27, 2021. It was attended by more than 150 community leaders. There was high praise for the services he rendered to the Indian American community. And DCG Sinha returned the praise for the community. “You have been an incredible, absolutely incredible representative of the Indian Government,” said Anil Bansal, president of FIA, describing Sinha as a “rare individual,” and going further to praise the support given to FIA because of his liaison. Padma Shri Sudhir Parikh, senior advisor to FIA said Sinha was a quintessential diplomat “who has the pulse of the community and the politics; who knows how to accomplish goals without fanfare; who works for their country’s glory and not their own benefit.” Dr. Parikh assured DCG Sinha he always had friends if he visited U.S. in the future, and hopefully return as the Consul General or Ambassador. Chairman of FIA Ankur Vaidya said, “It’s an honor to have known you, to have called you our friend, to call you our fraternity brother of FIA.” He thankedMrs. Sinha for allowing DCG Sinha to spend inordinately long hours fulfilling his duties and working with the Indian American community. EdisonMayoral Candidate Sam Joshi told the DCG, “You havemade great strides representing the Indian community. I am so honored to be in your presence.” Joshi noted Edison has the highest percentage of Indians in the U.S. A brief prayer was said by a priest to felicitate DCG Sinha and his wife. Numerous people garlanded him in appreciation. “During my tenure a few important things (happened),” DCG Sinha said. “FIA completed fifty years. Not many organizations last 50 years. It speaks volumes for what FIA has done.” “Today is a day of mixed feelings,” Sinha continued. He called his three years in New York “Very exciting, very fulfilling, and very satisfying.” That was mainly because of leaders like Dr. Sudhir Parikh and Ankur Vaidya, he said speaking as he was flanked by Dr. Parikh and Vaidya. The New York Consulate serves 10 states, Sinha noted. “With help of organizations like FIA, our reach is extended, our reach is magnified.” He particularly thanked the FIA for its work for India, every time any assistance is needed. “Especially during the Covid pandemic, we have received lot of support from FIA, not only in terms of individual contributions but also as an organization, in helping routing aid fomUnited States to India,” Sinha said, noting that FIA has received the Pravasi Bharatiya award, “and they totally deserve it.” TV Asia founder and CEO H.R. Shah recited a shayari in Hindi, complimenting DCG Sinha for raising the community so high and keeping it close to his heart.

Just Look At How Much It Spent On Wars. By Katrina vanden Heuvel Here’s the price tag: $5.48 trillion. No, that’s not the cost of what President Biden is calling a “generational investment” to rebuild America. That’s the price of the so-called War on Terror since 2001, as detailed by Brown University’s Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs - the cost to U.S. taxpayers of sending forces to Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen and other countries in a continuing war that, as Biden implied last week, has metastasized more than it has succeeded. Roughly half of that total - $2.3 trillion - went into Afghanistan. That total doesn’t include the priceless human cost of nearly 6,300 American lives lost, thousands more wounded, and the vast losses suffered by the Afghan people. Even as the foreign policy establishment savages Biden for ending a 20-year occupation in Afghanistan, one can only be outraged by the money and lives squandered on military adventures that have ended in disgraceful calamities. Contrast that sum - and those lives - with the $3.5 trillion that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., correctly dubs the “most consequential piece of legislation” since President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. It would begin to address the existential threat posed by climate change, reduce childhood poverty by half, expand public education from pre-K to free community college, extend health care through Medicare while making drugs more affordable, support families with help for day care, paid family leave and a child allowance and more. It is not enough - but it is a start. “This is the people’s budget,” Sanders notes. “This is the budget that will impact tens of millions of lives in this country: the elderly, the children, the working families, the middle class.” Trillions of dollars for debacles abroad versus trillions of dollars for investments at home. Yet, appropriations for the former zip through the Congress while the Biden domestic investments must overcome a filibuster by a unified Republican opposition and posturing by a handful of centrist Democrats demanding cuts. This isn’t because lawmakers are concerned about deficits. If nothing else, Republicans and hawks agree with what President George W. Bush’s vice president, Richard Cheney, said Ronald Reagan had taught us: “deficits don’t matter.” In fact, with the U.S. economy operating far from full capacity, with millions still available to be added to the labor force, and interest rates holding steady, America can afford to do what it needs to do. Republicans don’t worry about “paying for” the tax cuts they lavish on the rich and corporations. And hawks don’t worry about “paying for” the money squandered on foreign misadventures. Yet, to this day, Republicans denounce domestic investments as “socialism,” and even Democrats - from Biden to Sanders - accept that they must be paid for with offsetting revenue. The result is plain to see: a wealthy nation that squanders trillions of dollars on failure and folly abroad while its citizens, its economy, its democracy and its security are undermined at home. We are the only advanced country without paid family leave, without affordable day care, without public education pre-K to college. We are lagging, not leading, in the transition to renewable energy. Publicly funded research, earmarked for defense firms, lavishes money on weaponry while investment in civilian technology and in research and development fails to keep up with rivals such as China. After the debacle in Afghanistan, we need a broad reckoning, a fundamental reassessment of our priorities and our direction. The nation’s security demands it. As the war in Afghanistan ends, the pandemic is spiking once more at home - Europe now moves to ban American visitors because of our rising infection rates. Thanks to climate change, extreme weather - hurricanes, wildfires, floods, droughts - wreaks an increasing toll in lives and destruction. The imperative of addressing these threats to our security could not be more compelling Already, leading figures in the foreign policy establishment - the architects of past disasters - have concocted a new argument: that Biden was wrong to pull the plug on Afghanistan, that the United States’ security and credibility would be better served by maintaining a small number of troops in that country, backed by drones and air power. The retired generals and intelligence bureaucrats use the chaos and casualties of our exit from Afghanistan to prove their point. As Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told New York Times columnist Ezra Klein: “The pro-war crowd sees this as a mechanism by which they can absolve themselves of an accounting for the last 20 years.” But now, the failure of the armchair experts is impossible to miss. We need a new generation of security experts and activists - versed in pandemics and in poverty, in climate change and alternative energy, in political economy and diplomacy. We need a new consensus to advocate a strategy of restraint that focuses on diplomatic and economic engagement over military intervention. We must address the security threats we now face rather than continue the vain effort to police the world. SPECIAL TO THE WASHINGTON POST The Washington Post Katrina vanden Heuvel By J.V. Lakshmana Rao The US has “accomplished” its mission of clearing Afghanistan of its troops exactly on August 31, the deadline day, it set for itself. However, not all those nationals, who were waiting for evacuation, were able to be airlifted from the Kabul airport. A few have been left behind. They include some Americans. The US has left behind millions of dollars’ worth arms, military hardware and aircraft, but not before disabling or dismantling them. The US is stated to have invested at least $2.3 trillion in Afghanistan in the past 20 years. Now the future of troubletorn Afghanistan is gloomy. In all expectations the Taliban may form a governing council till a cohesive government is formed. However, Afghanistan becoming a democracy will be a pipedream and the US has once again failed in its objective.  It is not too much or hypothetical to expect that there can be a civil war or terrorists groups vie each other to capture power in Afghanistan. The Taliban, which waited on its wings, could have completed the capture of Afghanistan by August 15, much earlier than anticipated and without facing any resistance from the erstwhile National Army, while the US troops and other allied UK and NATO forces remained calm. However, there was a ghastly bomb blast by suspected Islamic State (ISIS-K) suicide bombers on August 26 followed by the retaliation from the US, changed the scenario. All these blasts diminish Taliban’s hopes of peaceful transfer of power after capturing Kabul, and now forming a credible and sustainable government in Afghanistan is not going to be an easy task. Therefore, the political future of Afghanistan is anybody’s guess. The US, the UK and Russia, based on their past experience, would not involve themselves in any form in Afghanistan. The only major country that is left in the field is China, though its interests lay in Afghan’s minerals and not in annexing and ruling or in helping the new government of the failed country, whoever forms it. And no major world power would be ready to recognize immediately any government to be formed in Afghanistan. But the exception may be lone Pakistan. In all probability, China may use Pakistan as a conduit to exploit riches of Afghanistan and also help Pakistan strengthen its ire against India.  Pakistan is quite vulnerable as it is already under the influence of China.  Pakistan, which harbors terrorists, is likely to back any government in Afghanistan formed by any militant or terrorist group, with an aim to increase its adventures on the border with India and cause trouble in Kashmir. India’s involvement in Afghanistan has been rightfully neutral and noncommittal, but aims at helping that country’s  infrastructure and staying away from its problems – internal or international. India, in the recent past, has provided more than $3 billion towards the construction of roads and buildings, supply of manpower, offer of expertise and development of infrastructure facilities in Afghanistan. The developmental works included the construction of the Afghanistan Parliament building costing $90 million; the Salma Dam, which provides water and electricity to thousands of families in the Herat province with a water storage capacity of 640 million cubic meters; restoration of 100-year-old Stor Palace; laying of strategic 218-km-long Zaranj-Delaram Highway connecting Zaranj near Iran’s border at a cost of Rs. 600 crore; and construction of the Indira Gandhi Institute for Child Health, which is the largest pediatric hospital in Afghanistan. Apart from these projects, India has also gifted 400 buses and 200 mini-buses, 105 utility vehicles for municipalities, 285 military vehicles for the Afghan National Army and 10 ambulances for government hospitals in five cities. Now, there are at least three other groups vying to take control of Afghanistan.  Besides the Taliban, the others are ISIS-K, al Qaeda and Northern Alliance. With all these four militant groups at work, it would be imprudent to hope Afghanistan will have a stable government. J.V.

He was 70. The cause was cardiac arrest, said Ruth Vanita, a University of Montana literature professor and the coeditor with Kidwai of the 2000 volume “Same-Sex Love in India: Readings From Literature and History.” A scion of a prominent Muslim family, Kidwai became an eminence in Delhi’s LGBTQ community with the publication of “Same-Sex Love in India.” The book was widely regarded as a foundational text for queer studies in India and was cited in hearings before the country’s Supreme Court, which ended the criminalization of homosexuality in 2018. “Saleem Kidwai and Ruth Vanita were the ammunition for us to advocate what our history was and how our culture was and how to reclaim it,” said Anand Grover, one of the lawyers who led the case for the repeal of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, under which homosexuality was illegal. That shift helped change the public atmosphere within which the justices would eventually render their decision, Grover said. “The mainstream history and for the vast majority of the people, the thinking was that Section 377 is part of our culture, and they had no idea that prior to the British it was a different ballgame,” he added. “Same-Sex Love in India” was a sweeping historical correction that sought to reclaim a rich repository of poetry and fiction celebrating romantic attachments that had been deliberately ignored. When Kidwai and Vanita embarked on their project in the early 1990s, much of the Indian academy, political establishment and social elite rejected homosexuality as an alien import from the West and an affront to Indian culture and society. “During the time that the book was first published, it was commonly asserted by homophobic cultural nationalists that homosexuality was never a part of Indian tradition,” Shohini Ghosh, a professor at the A.J.K. Mass Communication Research Center in India, wrote in an email. “It served as an eye opener to many, while to others it confirmed that queer love and its many manifestations had a long and vibrant history in South Asia.” Kidwai and Vanita had first met when both were lecturers at Delhi University - though in different colleges and disciplines. Kidwai was an associate professor in medieval and Mughal history at Ramjas College; Vanita taught literature. Independently, they had been collecting texts describing same-sex attraction and love from their readings, Kidwai in Urdu and Persian, Vanita in Sanskrit and other languages. “As you’d be reading, you’d find lots of things that would strike you and your gaydar would start tinging,” Kidwai later told Project Bolo, a collection of oral histories documenting the gay community in India. “Both Ruth and I had been doing similar things.” Queer studies didn’t really exist as a discipline in India at the time. In the Indian media, gay and lesbian couples, when they appeared at all, were mostly confined to the category of tragic circumstance - doomed love that ends, for example, in a double suicide by rat poison or self-immolation. Even private references were oblique. As Kidwai liked to recount, gossips dissecting the end of a marriage might mention that the man was impotent, though only with women. Until the 2018 judicial ruling, homosexuality was punishable by up to 10 years in jail. The anti-sodomy law, imposed by the British in India in 1861, was used to blackmail men trying to meet men for sex in public parks and, at the height of the AIDS crisis, to block the distribution of condoms in Indian jails. There were no gay bars or nightclubs in Delhi. Meetings were arranged surreptitiously, such as by leaving a red rose on a coffee shop table to signal that it was safe to approach. Kidwai had left his teaching job at Delhi University in 1993, and there were no major grants or establishment support for a project of this kind when he and Vanita embarked on the book. The two academics struggled to find a publisher, releasing the book first through a U.S. imprint in 2000 and publishing an Indian version a year later. In the two decades since its publication, “Same-Sex Love in India” has undergone 19 printings. “By translating literature about same-sex love from 15 Indian languages composed over more than 2,000 years, the book challenged the modern homophobic idea that homosexuality was a foreign import,” Vanita said. “Homosexuality wasn’t a foreign import. Homophobia was.” Kidwai was born Aug. 7, 1951, into a large landowning clan in Lucknow, the capital city of the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. He moved to Delhi at 17, ostensibly to study history at Delhi University, but also because he had realized that Indian small-town life would be too constraining for a gay man. He received his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in history and started teaching at Delhi University in 1973. He was granted leave from the university in 1976 to pursue PhD studies at McGill University in Montreal. On a terrifying evening in October 1977, Kidwai was among about 150 men arrested in an armed police raid on two Montreal gay bars. The men were subjected to compulsory VD tests and threatened with criminal charges. The raids provoked massive street protests the next day and, months later, Quebec banned discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. (The criminal charges, however, were not dropped for years.) By then, traumatized by his arrest, periodic court appearances and the constant threat of deportation, and disillusioned at the prospect of living openly as a gay man in the West, Kidwai fled Montreal and his PhD program to return to his university job as an associate professor of history in Delhi. He was open about his sexuality with his family and close friends, a circle that expanded even more rapidly after he left academia once he became eligible for voluntary retirement. In the 1990s, he became increasingly active in Delhi’s gay community, where he was in constant demand at conferences and on television talk shows. After moving back to Lucknow about two decades ago, he worked with television producers on a documentary about the late singer and actress Begum Akhtar. He also published English translations of Urdu novels and a memoir, and he entertained a constant throng of visiting Indian and Western academics, eager to tap Kidwai’s vast knowledge of the Mughal Empire, Hindustani classical music and Urdu literature. Survivors include three sisters. Asked by a Project Bolo interviewer whether he had any regrets in life, Kidwai replied wryly: “If I was to believe in rebirth, I would want to be born gay. Believe it or not. . . . I’m not a masochist but I’ve had fun.”. THE WASHINGTON POST Saleem Kidwai, Scholar Who Unearthed LongBuried Literature On Gay Love In India, Dies At 70 Saleem Kidwai in Facebook post dated Nov. 24, 2018 Photo: Facebook Hate Crimes Rise To Highest Level In 12 Years Amid Increasing Attacks On Blacks, Asians By David Nakamura WASHINGTON The number of hate crimes in the United States rose in 2020 to the highest level in 12 years, propelled by increasing assaults targeting Black and Asian victims, the FBI reported Monday. In all, the federal agency tallied 7,759 hate crimes last year, a tumultuous 12 months marked by a global pandemic, a divisive presidential election and upheaval in the economy. The total marked an increase of 6% from 2019 and the most since 2008, when 7,783 hate crimes were reported. It is the sixth time in the past seven years that the number of attacks rose. The number of hate crimes reported has increased by nearly 42% since 2014, according to federal data. Attacks targeting Blacks rose from 1,930 to 2,755, and the number targeting Asians jumped from 158 to 274, the data showed. Those figures come as civil rights groups have warned of increasing hostility toward minorities, amid a rise in white nationalism and an increase in violent crime levels nationwide. Attacks targeting Whites rose to 773, an increase of about 16%. Congress mandates that the FBI collect hatecrime data annually based on reports from local law enforcement agencies. In 2020, the number of agencies that participated in that effort fell for at least the second consecutive year - to 15,136, which is 422 fewer than in 2019. Of those agencies that did participate, the vast majority reported no hate crimes. Congressional Democrats and civil rights advocates have criticized what they describe as a large undercount in the number of hate crimes and other bias incidents, saying local police are poorly trained in how to identify and catalogue hate crimes and lack sufficient resources or interest in investigating them. Stop AAPI Hate, a grass-roots groups based in California, reported 6,603 hate incidents against Asians fromMarch 2020 - the start of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States - through March of this year. Of that data, which was collected through selfreporting portals online and was not thoroughly vetted, about 65% consisted of verbal harassment, such as name calling, and 12.6% involved physical assault. In May, Congress approved the Covid-19 Hate Crimes Act, which requires the Justice Department to appoint an official to expedite investigations into hate crimes reported to federal authorities. The bill also seeks to improve reporting of hate crimes among localities by bolstering online reporting channels and offering resources in more languages to help immigrants.

An amphitheater has been added which was an open air theater. Many more people got involved as BCCA started work. “All the work that was put in was voluntary. They were all seniors in age and in their work, all artists, dignitaries of performing arts, writers,” Shah told News India Times. Shah said BCCA has no offices assigned for its team. Anyone can sit anywhere with their laptops. The dignitaries are such big names that their just being there, voluntarily, attracts younger upcoming artists with hopes of learning something from them,” according to Shah. “People like Praveen Solanki and Siddhartha Randeria, masters of the Stage both, one being a great dramatist and the other an actor and director, just come and spend some time there. And that makes the center a cultural center with their presence by attracting younger hopeful artists,” Shah explained. The task of organizing and presenting two hundred programs is immense, and the team is working day and night to come up with new ideas, new forms, and new concepts. BCCA has begun with voluntary artistic and creative and technical contributions. BCCA needs to create an attractive and user-friendly website, and would welcome any volunteers to take up that challenge, according to Priti Shah, who explained that most of the teamhas not had enough time to do that. “This festival is now a talent spotting for good compositions and many singers, composers, and  lyricists have got their big break through this platform,” founder and Administrator of Cultural Activities, Lalit Shah, told News India Times. “We see a very healthy and bright future ahead for this festival, which welcomes and celebrates our Culture worldwide through the medium of internet and, of course, live events”, he said. The 2020 and 2021 online festivals are still available on the YouTube channel, as are other BCCA programs. (https://www. youtube.com/watch?v=Kw5zJhCBh5M) and (https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=wNLQSn8Eglk). The “swarkaar sammelan” is only one of BCCA’s activities. There are conversations with literary dignitaries including writers, poets and playwrights, there are classical dance performances, dance ballets, musical tributes and hard classical music performances. All of these in different languages, making the BCCA what it is, a cultural hotspot, in Shah’s words. Dr. Shrikant is said to have believed in the evolutionary nature of culture, which becomes an amalgamation of all cultures it comes in touch with, acquiring a wholly new expression. Bhavan’s Cultural Center Andheri seems to be doing just that. By Archana Adalja August 24th, the Vishwa Gujarati Diwas honoring Gujarati language, culture, and Gujarati poet Narmad, was celebrated with literary and cultural programs globally. Speaking on the occasion, India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, a Gujarati himself, wished all Gujaratis a happy World Gujarati Day and said in his Tweeter message, “Let’s make Gujaratiness meaningful with its sophistication, identity and sensitivity”. The World Gujarati Day is celebrated separately from the Gujarat Day which celebrates founding of Gujarat state, and which falls on May 1st, and it is celebrated separately from the International Mother Language Day, which falls on February 21st, and celebrates linguistic multiculturalism. The Vishwa Gujarati Diwas, as it is named, was celebrated in the U.S. with Gujarati literary groups in New Jersey, Atlanta and Chicago holding poetry recitations and cultural programs. Many of these events were held virtually due to Covid restrictions. Australian television and Japanese newspapers reported local celebrations of the Gujarati Day. In India, the day was celebrated with special literary and cultural programs at the universities in Surat, Ahmadabad, and other cities of Gujarat. Organizations such as the Gujarati Literary Association of Rajasthani Sammelan Education Trust, Sahitya Sarita Mumbai, Mumbai Gujarati Sangathan and many universities in Mumbai including the SNDT university which paid special tributes to the poet Narmad with panel discussions, plays and garba dances and other cultural programs. In Surat, his birthplace, Narmad’s birthday was celebrated at his home which is now turned into a museum and a library. August 24th was the birthday of the great Gujarati poet Narmadashankar Lalshankar Dave,  better known as Narmad, who has been considered the father of the modern Gujarati language. A staunch and proud admirer and appreciator of Gujarat and Gujarati language, Narmad’s “jay jay garvi Gujarat” has been adopted as Gujarat state’s anthem. It was Narmad’s idea that Gujarat lives in the mind of every Gujarati, no matter where he lives. “Jya jya vase ek Gujarati, tya tya sadakaal Gujarat” (where lives one Gujarati, that place is forever Gujarat), he wrote. And it is his birthday which is celebrated every year as the international Gujarati Narmad (August 24, 1833 – February 26, 1886) was a poet, essayist, biographer, critic, journalist, social reformist, and a lexicographer. His most precious gift to the language is the new dictionary he wrote in the midst of severe hardships. His is the first dictionary of Gujarati into Gujarati, while other Gujarati language dictionaries contained Gujarati words explained in English. Narmad’s dictionary is more symbolic of his efforts to unify all the different regions of Gujarat, each of which spoke a different language with different usage, different accents and different consonants. Narmad listed all the words of all dialects with their different usages. In keeping with Narmad’s philosophy, the Vishwa Gujarati Diwas is a day dedicated to the Gujarati language, and to Gujarati culture as well. Geographically not very large, the state of Gujarat has distinct separateness in language, food and culture within the state. If we adopt and modify the famous Gujarati quote today, we can say “boli badlay dagle dagle” (language changes at every step). So is the food different in every region, in content, texture and taste. Cultural traditions also differ and although Gujarat is one state, one would find differences from home to home. As a thinker and activist, Narmad wanted to see unity. He was averse to separatism. And  wrote, Parvat upar thi veer purvajo De aashish jaykar sampe saue sau jaat Jay jay garvi Gujarat! Our valiant forefathers are showering blessings From the mountains, that we all live peacefully together and be victorious Victory to proud Gujarat! As an educationist, Narmad’s ideas that basic primary education is better attained in one’s own language, were ahead of his times and perhaps our times too. It is only recently that the United Nation’s Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has recognized the importance of mother languages in development, in maintaining cultural diversity and cohesiveness and intercultural dialogue. It was in 1999 that UNESCO proclaimed February 21st as the International Mother Language Day, and it was in 2007 that the United Nations passed a resolution about it. This was thought and written by Narmad more than a hundred years ago. Narmad’s literary contribution in terms of essays, criticism, and poems is immense and thought provoking. His was tough love. He did not write soft romantic poems. His poems all speak his vigor and tough and uplifting language. Be it “ya hom kari ne pado fateh chhe aage”(jump into the battlefield, victory is yours), or “daglu bharyu ke na hatwu na hatwu” (don’t hesitate or move once you have taken a step – which means one must be firm and determined). His idea that literature should be accessible and understandable by all seems like the foundation of modern journalism. Being a social reformist and against religious extreme ideas, Narmad had believed and practiced reforms he wrote about, including widow remarriage. Long before Gandhi, he prepared Gujarat to value and uphold truth, character, tenacity, equality for all, nationality and patriotism. And fulfilling his dream, Gujarat has given many important contributors to the world and to India, some of them very famous - Mahatma Gandhi the political activist, Kanaiyalal Munshi the writer, educationist, and activist, Narsimh Mehta the great poet who gave us “vaishnav jan to tene re kahiye”, Vikram Sarabhai the scientist, Sonal Mansingh the Odyssey dancer, Sanjeev Kumar the great actor, Alka Yagnik the popular and gifted singer, and so many more that pages would not be enough to write the names. Unlike Gujarati Literature, Gujarati food holds a special place on people’s palate. “Dhokla”, “Muthiya”, “Khandawi”, “Undhiyu”, “Puranpoli”, “ganthiya” all are liked everywhere. Gujarati “chaniyacholi-odhni” have been modified to look like gorgeous modern dresses. Gujarati garba dance popularized by Bollywood films has been adopted by everyone. What passes off as garba dance in Bollywood does not carry the original movements of the original garba today when its civilized, organized, slow movement of the collective dance form is mixed with the vigorous and athletic end-of-the-day rural and tribal dance with pronounced hands-and-feet movements borrowed fromMaharashtrian “lawni” and “lezim”, the Punjabi “bhangra”, and the Konkani fisher-folk’s melodious dance. And this remix is still called the Gujarati garba dance. Gujaratis and Gujarati culture today, seems to have been transformed into such a remix, especially in the immigrant community. Being far from homeland, the enlargement of vision and heart seems to have slowly expanded the heart so much as to bring up close and personal all Indians, and created a bonding of one “desi” community Narmad would have been proud to have seen. Multiculturalism where all cultures preserving their individuality exist side by side seems redundant in these new times. Now seems the era of confluence or fusion of all cultures which, with interchanges, gives us a young half Indian half Russian girl performing all three sections of Kathak, - Vandana, Nritta, and Nritya – effortlessly, fusion which gives us a two year old Indian American girl speaking four different languages which includes Gujarati, her father-tongue, fusion which gives us pasta with “jeera vaghar”, and fusion which makes us hold traditional Indian weddings and also cut the cake. While Gujarati Literature and language need serious life-preserving nurturing, this fusion seems to have become the new version of the Gujarati culture, a version Narmad, a free-thinking innovator, perhaps would have liked Cover Story Vishwa Gujarati Diwas Commemorates Poet Narmad Reviving An Interest Continued From Page 5 Poet Narmad’s Signature ‘Narmad’ at Veer Narmad South Gujarat University, Surat, Gujarat, India.

And if, instead of one such stray song, one gets a bouquet of songs? That is what Gujaratis athirst for some quality Gujarati poems experienced listening to one after the other creative compositions of Gujarati poems and songs offered by the “Swarkaar Sammelan”, a music festival of composers, organized by Bhavan’s Cultural Center Andheri (BCCA) and Bhavan’s Kala Kendra, Chowpaty August 7th through 10th. BCCA has been a cultural institute of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan which has 170 centers in India and around the world. BCCA has been actively holding art and culture festivals for more than fifteen years and is one of the most culturally enhanced centers. Today, BCCA organizes 200 programs a year, collaborating with Bhavan’s Chowpaty Kala Kendra, and these coming from the suburb of the crowded city of Mumbai, which, unlike Calcutta, is far from the title of a cultural city. This year’s four-day “sugam sangeet” or light classical music festival on the digital platform paid tribute to the composers, as do all “Swarkaar Sammelan”s organized by BCCA. The digital format, idea of Deepak Shah, a raga-pianist, who is a member of the “sammelan” team, made the festival easily available, free of cost, on BCCA’s YouTube channel, to thousands of overseas Indians who enjoyed the festival while it was on in spite of time differences and provided heartening and appreciative feedback, sitting in their homes in different cities in the U.S., in the United Kingdom, in Germany, in Australia and in many other countries. The four-day music festival has been a regular annual event, providing a much needed platform to the upcoming composers to display their art, many of whom have gone on to have successful careers after their talents were discovered on the festival. Named “Swarkaar Sammelan”, the festival consists of Gujarati poems, songs, ghazals, and more. The idea of the music festival turned talent show began with the idea of doing something for Gujarati culture and providing a much needed platform to the composers in Gujarati. Noted composer and singer Padmashree Purushottam Upadhyay who has become an institute in himself for singers, mentioned in his opening remarks, “Singers get acclaimed but no one remembers the composers. So we thought about a convention for them. It has been our philosophy and our aim to provide an opportunity and a platform to the new composers and singers in Gujarati”, he said. The festival participation has been open to all composers and all singers speaking any language, as long as the compositions are Gujarati. “Any words which do not hurt any sentiments and are not crude, can be composed by the composer,” said Priti Shah, Emcee, Concept Writer, Director and Editor, to News India Times. A notable aspect of the festival is that the participating compositions are all created for already existing lyrics and poems, which is a harder endeavor than first creating musical notes and then creating lyrics. Gujarati poetry, especially the newone, is experimental in formand does not always become singable.  The “sammelan” is doingwhat Producers’ Guild and Indian National Theater did in the seventies for drama, both of which organized inter-collegiate drama competitions and brought to theworld of stagemany new talents, andmany newwriters. Composers await the announcement of dates for the “sammelan”, now that six festivals have been held. Themembermusic dignitaries are sowell-known that artists flock to perform in front of them. Like last year, this year’s festival presented fifty poems and songs of forty six poets. Thirty two composers participated in the four-day festival. The joy it brings is not just through the songs. It becomes a triple treat of a good and expressive poem, beautifully sung by the singer, and, dexterously composed by the composers. The festival also served two purposes for Gujarati literature, presenting some beautiful and impressive poems and works of Gujarati literature, and in a fresh music composition. And thus, one could hear poems of master poets Suresh Dalal, Harindra Dave, Madhav Ramanuj, Krushnalal Shreedharani, Mareez, Ramesh Parekh, Jalan Matari, and others. And one could also hear works of latter day Gujarati poets including Dhruv Bhatt, Ramesh Jani, Chandrakant Shah, Muktanand Swami, Pururaj Joshi, Nandita Thakore and many others. The composers, the main feature of the festival, ranged from noted composer Padmashree PurushottamUpadhyay, Asit Desai, and Gaurang Vyas to Suresh Joshi, Shraddha Shreedharani, Prahar Vora, Yash Antani, Nayan Pancholi, Sugam Vora, Snehal Mazumdaar, and many others. The singers’ list included more than forty two young and old, male and female singers. Founder of BCCA and one of the organizers of the festival Niranjan Mehta spoke of great response to the online festival. “We worry sometimes what will happen to Gujarati language which has such a rich heritage of songs, plays, poems. We wonder what would be its future,” said Mehta. But the response to the Composers’ Convention since 2006 has been tremendous, according to him. “I feel we don’t need to worry about the future of Guajarati language looking at the interest even the younger generation is taking in Gujarati literature and culture,” he said. Last year’s digital festival, born out of necessity due to Covid restrictions, was watched by close to one thousand people. “This year was different,” said Priti Shah. “It is bigger than last year’s online festival. Last year we were novices and were not very sure about how it would be received,” she said. Bhavan’s College, Andheri, has a great expanse of grounds, spread over more than forty eight acres of land, in the midst of the crowded city, sprawling with rose gardens, a temple of Shiva, a natural lake, a natural hill, and much more, along with a library, Arts and Humanities college, engineering college, science college, canteen, a bookstore, hostels, auditoriums, and more. A number of features have been added over the years. The cultural center’s expansion concept was born in 2003, with the then Andheri Bhavan’s Chairman, Dr. M.L. Shrikant’s idea of creating a multilingual and multi-dimensional culture center on the campus. His vision was to provide a “modern bridge” to all arts in all forms, past, present and future, within Mumbai’s suburbs. Lalit Shah of Copwood, joined in voluntarily along with others like Niranjan Mehta and the music maestro Purushottam Upadhyaya. Lalit Verma, and Shri Anil Kavish, completed the founding team, all of whom were volunteers. Lalit Shah today holds the office of Cultural Activities. Lalit Shah’s plan for the already existing Cultural Center’s enhancement involved preparing the campus grounds for cultural activities. The natural lake behind the college buildings was cleaned and has become a beautiful spot. The rough patches of flower beds around the temple have been now turned into Bhavan’s Nature and Adventure Center. ‘Gujaratiness’ Reviving an interest in Gujarati literature and music Composers of the music festival.
