This is not correct. Cricket has been an immensely popular sport in the Subcontinent since the 1930s mostly patronized by the Rajas and Nawabs and to some extent by the Britishers. After Independence Hockey was declared the National game and it did bring laurels to the country winning three Olympic Golds (1948,1952,1956) but surprisingly Cricket held its own among the masses despite the team’s dismal and often pathetic showing. It was indeed ironic to see more books and write ups on Indian cricket players and the team after every disastrous performance while very few if any books at that time came out glorifying Hockey or Football. We have books on and about the former cricketers who wrote about their exploits on the domestic circuit and talked emotionally about the defeats they suffered at the international level. Intriguingly every defeat againstWest Indies, England, Australia, and even Pakistan brought more crowds to the stadiums. Instead of thinning the support base, the craze for cricket kept expanding. Every defeat was laced with some myths and few and far victories in that era became a sort of folklore. “Cricket around theWorld is built on myths and Indian cricket is no different. These myths have been repeated ad nauseam over the years till they have come to be accepted as fact,” opines Gulu Ezekiel. To demolish these myths and de-glamourize some of the cricketing folklore, Gulu Ezekiel set out on a tough, unpopular and arduous journey. And the result is a 232- page  book-   MYTH-BUSTING Indian Cricket Behind The Headlines. Gulu is a veteran sports journalist but he LIVES  cricket. This is his 14th book and the second that this writer is reviewing. Reviewing a book written by a friend is a very tough job and on top of that, if it is specifically related to cricket. Because 90 percent, the chances are that the writer and reviewer know each other. I know Gulu for over two decades and having lavishly praised his previous co-authored book – Speed Merchant, I was apprehensive about this one. But a foreword written by Anil Kumble made the job easier. Kumble sums up the book nicely. “Gulu’s attempt to demystify some of these myths of Indian cricket is unique and commendable. His desire to sift fact from fiction and the painstaking research that has clearly gone into the process is evident. Underneath the facts, stories, and anecdotes, lies the desire to get rid of some of these existing myths and rumours, in order to purify this beautiful game,” Kumble says. Myth Busting has several startling facts which so far have been camouflaged and one of them is about Ranji Ranji Trophy is now a part of Indian cricket’s folklore. The hallowed tournament named after Shri Sir Ranjitsinhji Vibhaji, Maharaja Jamsahab of Nawanagar aka Ranji has showcased domestic talent which took the sport in the country to its pinnacle. In the chapter “Ranji. the legend and the myth” the author quotes the first Secretary of Board of Cricket Control India, BCCI, Anthony de Mello who said, “Ranji did absolutely nothing for Indian Sports and Sportsmen.” According to de Mello, “We approached Ranji with a request that Duleep (Sinhji) be encouraged to bring his cricket talents to the aid of India. To all our requests for aid, encouragement and advice, Ranji, gave but one answer: Duleep and I are English cricketers.” To this Gulu writes ‘India’s embracing of the legend and the man, even though he played his major cricket in England and had a hardened disdain for all things connected to Indian cricket, is not unique” There are several myths that have been accepted because they are harmless and amusing. One of them being an imaginary quote attributed to Australian captain “mate you have just dropped the world cup” after his rival dropped a catch in that tournament. In India Salim Durrani, the handsome allrounder was nicknamed the Sixer Man who hit a Six whenever the crowd demanded or asked for it. This myth has been punctured by Gulu pointing out that though the tall Pathan was a rare talent, he hit only 15 Sixes in 50 innings. Most of the cricket fans lament that because of a strike on BBC they could not watch Kapil Dev’s historic 175 against Zimbabwe in the 1983World Cup. Gulu effectively demolishes this myth proving that two other matches on that day involving England/Pakistan and Australia/West Indies had live telecast.  If there was a strike how come these two matches were shown is the question. The author has an answer because India/Zimbabwe match was not a priority event for the BBC and both the teams were considered rank outsiders.  After India’s stunning performance this canard of the strike was spread which became a myth and was later accepted as a fact. There is a detailed chapter on the ‘Tied’ test titled “Chepauk’s Many Myths.” It is about the test match between India and Australia in 1986 played in then Madras. The author details the test proceedings with quotes from the players, media persons, and umpires which are contradictory. He comes to the conclusion the tied test was after all, not that tied. But as it has been officially recognized as tied test number two he ends it with a quote from opener K. Srikkanth– “Hay guys, forget the win, we have become part of history.” Gulu also challenges another myth, viz., that Bishan Singh Bedi virtually surrendered the Test againstWest Indies by declaring when the team lost five wickets for 97 at Sabina Park Jamaica. He shows that there was nothing the skipper could do as the other five players were injured and unfit to bat and the story that the Indian captain declared in protest is false. The book is full of reality checks. It also contradicts Farokh Engineer’s assertion that he scored the fastest test century from just 47 balls. The dashing wicketkeeper batsman has also claimed that he hit three boundaries off the first three balls he faced on his debut but that claim has also been proven wrong. “Engineer is not the first and certainly not the last among many Famous sportspersons to embellish his own deeds with colorful stories which have entered cricket folklore and are accepted as gospel truth” (Page198), Gulu notes. The book also covers Engineer’s sullen reaction after Abid Ali hit the winning run in that historic Oval test in 1971. The Wicketkeeper was on the other end on 28. He had scored 59 in the first innings. Engineer said at that time, ‘Abid rushed out, got a top edge, and voila, we were home and Abid was a hero, never mind how he got the run.’ Except that it was not a top edge, it was a square cut to the boundary and the video footage is freely available (page 206). There are several other intriguing myths perpetuated for decades like “Mankading” which have been de-mystified by Gulu. The book also vividly recalls Indian cricket’s Grand Slammoments from June 1983 to March 1985. It details Kapil Dev’s era Before and After. The younger generation’s aggressiveness epitomized by Virat Kohli etc. As Anil Kumble writes “The true hero of this book is Gulu,” and he is absolutely correct. Myth -Busting is not any other cricket book. It is a well-documented thesis which is very absorbing, funny, sometimes hilarious, and as its jacket proclaims it is a cricket connoisseur’s delight. To sum it up MYTH-BUSTING is simply unputdownable. Harpal Singh Bedi is a veteran sports journalist and former Sports Editor at United News of India. He has covered 8 Olympics, 9 Asian Games and several other national and international sports events. Book jacket of ‘MYTH-BUSTING: Indian Cricket Behind The Headlines, by author Gulu Ezekiel.

Ashwin last played a Twenty20 International four years ago but was one of three specialist slow bowlers selected, along with leg-spinner Rahul Chahar and mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy. The tournament, which begins next month, was scheduled to be held in India but the COVID-19 situation in the country forced organisers to shift it to the United Arab Emirates and Oman. “The wickets in the UAE are usually low and slow and you need an off-spinner in your side,” chief selector Chetan Sharma told a virtual news conference. “Ashwin has been doing consistently well in the Indian Premier League over the years. Washington Sundar could have been another option but he remains injured.” Wrist-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Yadav were omitted and opener Shikhar Dhawan was also left out. Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul are likely to open for India while Ishan Kishan, who can also keep wicket, was picked as a third option. “Ishan Kishan can open the innings and he can fit in the middle order as well,” Chetan Sharma said. “He gives us lot of options.” Captain Virat Kohli has been toying with the idea of opening the innings and Sharma said the teammanagement would take a final call on this. India named three all-rounders in the squad —Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel. Suryakumar Yadav was picked ahead of fellow Mumbai player Shreyas Iyer, who is returning from a shoulder injury and has been named as one of three reserves. Inaugural champions India begin their bid for a second title in a Super 12 match in Dubai against archrivals Pakistan on Oct. 24.

This year Ganesh Chaturthi falls on September 10. So let’s ‘Shri Ganesh’ the celebratory spirit by listening to these top-notch Bollywood songs dedicated to Lord Ganesha. 1. ‘Mourya Re’ from ‘Don’ (2011) Featuring none other than Shah Rukh Khan, this song is a must-have for the Ganpati celebrations. The song captures the raw and real essence of the celebration in Mumbai -- with music, dance, devotion and huge crowds. SRK aces the street-style look with a white shirt and a piece of religious yellow cloth tied around his forehead. Sung by Shankar Mahadevan, penned by Javed Akhtar and composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, this super-energetic number never gets old. Iconic line: “ Tujhko firse jalwa dikhana hi hoga, agle baras aana hai aana hi hoga.” 2. ‘Deva Shree Ganesha’ from ‘Agneepath’ (2012) Despite so many songs dedicated to the elephantheaded God, this track continues to remain popular year after year. Sung in the powerful voice of Ajay Gogavale, the song features actors Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi with great zeal. Filled with energy, colours and great music, the song is a delight to listen to, watch and dance on. The hearttouching lyrics are penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya. The feet-tapping song involves not just Hrithik’s dancing but also adds layers to his character. While the song is playing in the background, Hrithik’s character Vijay reveals his identity to the villain and kills him in the middle of the celebration. The groovy number is composed by Ajay-Atul. Iconic line: “Darr bhi usse darra re, jiski rakhwaliyaan re, karta saya tera, deva Shree Ganesha...” 3. ‘Shambhu Sutaya’ from ‘ABCD: Any Body Can Dance’ (2013) When it comes to celebrating Lord Ganesha, Prabhudeva and the ‘ABCD: Any Body Can Dance’ series cannot be forgotten. Sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Vishal Dadlani, this song features one of the finest dancing moves, groovy beats, energy and swag. As red colour flies in the celebratory air, the dancers unleash their outstanding moves with passion and devotion. As the song progresses, it leads to a dance face-off, and ultimately becomes a fight between the two competing groups. Composed by Sachin Jigar, the impressive lyrics are written by Mayur Puri and the number is directed by Remo D’Souza. Iconic line: “Riddhi siddhi vriddhi hoti...Ho tere hi aane se...” 4. ‘Shree Siddhivinayak Mantra And Aarti’ (2016) This rendition of the traditional aarti is sung by Bollywood megastar Amitabh Bachchan. Hit the play button and gently close your eyes. Big B’s first word “Om” is enough to transcend you to a spirit of devotion, faith and gratitude. Having 100 million views (and counting) on YouTube, this powerful aarti is directed by Shoojit Sircar. Amitabh Bachchan’s voice hits straight at the heart, offering comfort and peace to the devotees. Iconic line: Any and every line sung by Amitabh Bachchan. We really can’t pick one! 5. ‘Suno Ganpati Bappa Morya’ from ‘Judwaa 2’ (2017) One of the latest Bollywood Ganpati tracks to dance to, this fun track is sung by Amit Mishra. The song captures the relationship of Varun Dhawan’s character Raja with his best friend and protector Ganpati Bappa. Danish Sabri penned the lyrics in urban Indian lingo. Varun’s signature twist moves steal the show. The peppy music is composed by SajidWajid. Iconic line: “Thoda innocent thoda shararati, jaisa bhi hoon tujhko meri khabar hai.” 6. ‘Jaidev Jaidev Aarti’ (2022) This aarti is sung by one of the most melodious singers of Bollywood, Shreya Ghoshal. The recently released aarti is a perfect ode to Lord Ganesha. The lyrics are of the traditional ‘Jaidev Jaidev Aarti’. Shreya’s voice sets the mood for devotion and submission of self to the mighty Ganesha. Presented by Salim-Sulaiman’s Merchant records, this symphonic aarti is produced by music director Gulraj Singh. The video also captures the process of a sand art of the mighty god with a modak in his hand. The music by the globally-recognised Budapest Symphony Orchestra adds to the charm and magic of the aarti. Iconic line: “ Sankati Pavave Nirvani Rakshave Survarvandana || Jaidev Jaidev.” So be it a peaceful family aarti or an energetic number to dance to, these songs will get you into the spirit of Ganesh Chaturthi filled with happiness, fun and peace. -ANI Photo:YoutubeviaANI Stills from various Ganpati songs.

The 38-year-old actor told IndieWire that his latest role as Zed, a Pakistani rapper whose career is threatened when he’s diagnosed with an autoimmune disease, was “about intense weight loss”, reported People magazine. “I lost 10 kilos [about 22 pounds] in three weeks. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone,” Ahmed said. The actor was sure to enlist the help of an expert to safely undergo his extreme weight loss for ‘Mogul Mowgli’, but he said the process was still challenging. “I had a professional dietician working with me, but it was really grueling and took me emotionally to an intense place, which probably informed the movie,” he explained. “That was a big part of it, being in a place of weakness and fatigue and insatiable hunger,” the actor added. Ahmed quoted fellow actor Daniel Kaluuya to explain his process for embodying Zed, telling IndieWire, “Dan Kaluuya said something I liked: ‘If you’re in your head, you’re dead.’ I think that’s true.” He added, “Acting has to be in your body. Anything that brings you into your body centres you, and you can perform in that place.” Ahmed’s latest role comes not long after he played another musician onscreen in ‘The Sound of Metal’, the 2019 film in which he starred as a drummer named Ruben who is losing his hearing. To bring his character to life, Ahmed learned how to play the drums, he told People magazine in December. “As soon as I met Darius Marder, the director, he told me: Listen, we’re going to do this all for real. When you’re drumming onscreen, you’re going to be drumming for real. And when you’re playing a gig, we’re gonna play in a real nightclub in front of a real audience,” Ahmed said. The actor described playing an instrument as “a very psychological thing,” adding, “You can’t think your way through playing the drums, you have to kind of surrender; you have to let them play you almost. You have to trust. I think it kind of opened me up in new ways.” While his role in ‘The Sound of Metal’ didn’t require the gruelling physical changes he underwent for ‘Mogul Mowgli’, Ahmed modified his body in a different way to play Ruben. The actor told People magazine he wore “modified hearing aids placed deep into my ear canal” that played white noise. The sound was so intense that Ahmed “couldn’t even hear myself speak,” he added.. -ANI Riz Ahmed Opens Up About His Transformation For Latest Movie ‘Mogul Mowgli’ Chris Pizzello/PoolviaREUTERS Riz Ahmed arrives to the Oscars red carpet for the 93rd Academy Awards in Los Angeles, California, U.S., April 25, 2021. A Minute With: ‘Mumbai Diaries’ Director And Actor On Medical Thriller Shankar’s Next Directorial Starring Ram Charan, Kiara Advani Goes On Floors -LONDON Medical thriller “Mumbai Diaries 26/11” looks back at the 2008 Islamist militant attack on the Indian city of Mumbai through the eyes of first responders and staff at a hospital as they fight to save lives. The eight-part television series is based on the four-day attack, which began on Nov. 26, 2008 when a group of militants targeted key landmarks in India’s financial capital. More than 160 people died. Reuters spoke to director Nikkhil Advani and actress Konkona Sen Sharma about the series, to be released on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, Sept. 9, 2021. Below are excerpts edited for length and clarity. Q: What inspired you to make a series based on the events in 2008? Advani: “I know friends who lived in NewYork and who were living in Boston and NewYork and on 9/11, everybody had a story (saying) ‘I was here on 9/11. I was here when the towers came down. I was here and when the planes went into the building’. Similarly, 26/11 has the same kind of feeling for most Indians and especially Mumbaikars living in Mumbai. It’s a day that’s etched in our memories.” Q: How did you come up with the concept for the show? Advani: “I know lately people have been hearing about oxygen not being available…and medicines not being available (to treat COVID-19). That’s the reality that the ordinary Indian lives with in this country. “Now, you have doctors who just have mad motivation and dedication to just get you better. They don’t have infrastructure, they don’t have facilities, and that’s a normal day for them. They’re dealing with that every single day. And what if I flipped that and made that an extraordinary day, and what if that day is 26/11? That’s the story of what we are doing.” Q: What preparation did you do for the show? Sen Sharma: “Overall for the show, we needed to know what happened and how we are choosing to portray it and what is our attitude…, and for that actually the script was very detailed. We had a lot of discussions with the director and his team. “…We’re all actors, none of us are doctors…, so we all had to learn the basics – sutures and putting on gloves really quickly and injections and basic medical terms and things like that.” Q: Was there a scene that was particularly impactful? Sen Sharma: “There is a moment where my character has an interaction with one of the terrorists, which is a very weird, obviously horrifying, terrifying, very frightening experience. But also there is a moment of connection, which is just a very weird and unusual thing and an unexpected thing to happen. So it’s weirdly emotional.”. -Reuters Actors Ram Charan and Kiara Advani’s upcoming film directed by Shankar went on the floors on Wednesday at Annapurna Studios in Hyderabad.

In came Sam Singh to fill that gap. A successful, fast-growing businessman, especially in the entertainment space in United States, Singh naturally gravitated to sports and was a natural for taking up Mir’s Indian team. Singh, along with his Chief Consultant Sunil Hali, a veteran in marketing, entertainment and media space, worked closely with Mir to reach a deal. The rest is now history in the making, as Sam Singh becomes the 1st and proud owner of Premium Indians USA KINGS, the Indian team for AP, the press release said. That landmark acquisition, was what resulted in the August 30, high-profile event where the formal announcement of the acquisition was made at the Lake Chateau inWoodbridge, N.J. More than 100 guests from the Tri-state area, including leading media were present that evening as Singh made what is considered an historic announcement, and one greeted with much excitement. “Good evening everyone. I am humbled with your presence to join us on this historic day when we are making a dream come true,” Singh said. “We all have lived with cricket since childhood. Amongst many other things that we missed all these years in USA, cricket is certainly on top of the list,” he added. “We watch Cricket on TV, in cinema halls and online. But we still were missing the real-life experience. Now the moment is here.” Singh said he got the opportunity to explore cricket in reality in America. “And obviously I took the Indian team to represent our nation. I am working day and night with my team and APL to make sure we present true and competitive cricket,” Singh said, adding, “While as a sportsman I wish every team a great success but my dream is to win the 1st season and you all to join to cheer our team in every game.” He assured those present the game would be ‘exciting and satisfying especially when you each come with family and friends.” He urged everyone to come for every game to make the APL matches a great success. “I thank Jay Mir, chairman of APL who has created this event. Lets celebrate American Premiere League!” Hali expanded on the plans to present the Premium Indians in best possible way and target to win the 1st season which has a winning prize of $75,000 and a viewership of 5 million plus nonresident Indians. “We plan to have a very competent team that will be highly professional and play the game in the best way. We are aware of the expectations and building the team with great care. It is a long haul over next few seasons when we will take the game to the highest level and make it an international cricketing event in coming years”. Mir was highly appreciative of Sam Singh for stepping forward and buying the Premium Indians USA Kings. Mir looks forward to a close association with Singh to build APL as Premium Indians is the hottest team, the press release said. Mir has a vision to build APL with more teams in coming years from countries which have strong community presence in the U.S., the press release said. “I want to bring communities together and build through cricket,” Mir is quoted saying. Asif Jamal, President of APL and COO of ARY Digital North America, was all praise for Mir launching such gigantic enterprise. Jamal was among the first to join the project from ARY Digital. And provided full support to Mir to get the project off the ground. “ARY Digital has been in forefront when it comes to cricket in sub-continent. And now we are with cricket from 1st day as it enters in USA,” said Jamal. The event was attended by prominent Indian and Pakistani Americans.

Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alternative party, was elected as far back as in 2013 and entered the Council in 2014. She is the only member from Socialist Alternative to be elected to public office. She is also a member of Democratic Socialists of America. According to the Seattle Times news report Sept. 8, 2021, the Recall Sawant campaign began collecting signatures in April and needs the King County Elections to validate at least 10,687 of the signatures from Sawant’s District 3 voters. If that many signatures are validated, out of the more than 16,000 collected so far, the special election will have to be held between 45-90 days after the validation, said the Times. The Recall Sawant petition claims Sawant used city resources to promote the “Tax Amazon” ballot initiative, as well as allowing members of the public to enter City Hall during protests when Covid restrictions were in place in early June, 2020, Seattle Times reported. According to socialistalternative.org, Sawant won her first election with over 90,000 votes, to become the first socialist in Seattle to win an election in nearly one hundred years. She was re-elected in 2019 securing 52 percent of the vote, according to aWashington Post report. Sawant, a former software engineer, has been a forceful campaigner for the $15 minimum wage initiative, and a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as well as relentlessly pursuing the Tax Amazon effort. A November 2019 report after that year’s elections, carried in TheWashington Post, noted Sawant’s strong backing for tax on large companies and the $15 minimum wage. “But Sawant’s campaign for reelection this year pitted her against Amazon, Seattle’s largest private employer, more conspicuously than ever,” the report noted, adding, “The retail giant has put $1.5 million toward City Council races this cycle, via a business-interest group that spent nearly half a million dollars in support of Sawant’s opponent—a massive expansion of the company’s efforts to shape politics on its home turf.” Sawant’s victory was hailed by left Democrats including Sen. ElizabethWarren, D-Massachusetts. “Nobody in Seattle has caused more headaches for the political establishment over the past seven years than Kshama Sawant,” the Socialist Alternative says on its website.

Bangladeshi Couple Sentenced For ‘Conspiring To Provide Material Support To ISIS’ Ahusband and wife, originally from Bangladesh, were sentenced to prison for conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. According to a Sept. 9, 2021, press release from the office of the  United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Shahidul Gaffar, 40, and Nabila Khan, 35, both residents of Pennsylvania, were sentenced to 18 months and two years in prison, respectively, by United States District Court Judge Joshua D. Wolson who also sentenced both defendants to three years of supervised release. According to court documents sourced in this press release, in 2015, Gaffar and Khan, a married couple originally from Bangladesh, provided and attempted to provide financial support to two of Khan’s brothers who traveled to Syria to join ISIS fighters. Gaffar and Khan discussed the brothers’ travel plans in detail with each other, as well as with the brothers and other family members, as early as September 2014. In January 2015, Khan asked her sister living in Bangladesh to sell some of Khan’s gold and provide the money to their oldest brother, J.K., including for the other brother I.K., both identified only by their initials in the press release, in order to assist him in travelling to Syria. The press release quotes a series of email exchanges between the husband and wife on the ‘conspiracy’. One of the brothers , I.K. was ultimately killed in the fighting in Syria in March 2019. “The defendants encouraged and financially supported the efforts of Nabila Khan’s brothers to join the murderous terrorist group ISIS, which is a direct threat to the United States,” Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Jennifer Arbittier Williams, is quoted saying in the press release. By a StaffWriter and destabilizing aftermath shattered the notion that the United States is indispensable and a force for democracy,” Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Today’sWorldView. “Had there been no invasion of Iraq, the mythology of American exceptionalism at home and abroad would have persisted among elites for a lot longer.” Rather than being in history’s driving seat, America’s policy elites are more aware that they, too, are passengers. The expensive, bloody entanglements in Afghanistan and Iraq ran alongside an epochal financial crisis that shocked the global economy. The United States recovered better than many other developed countries, but a necessary inwardness set in, with many politicians more preoccupied by the need for renewal and rebuilding at home than calls for intervention abroad. “9/11 has shattered the U.S. pretension to global indispensability,” wrote StephenWertheim of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Two decades more and the United States might yet become a nation among nations, no longer lording its power over others to get what it needs.” But the United States does still appear to be girding itself for another confrontation. The Biden administration is attempting to pull off the strategic pivot to Asia - where China looms - that its predecessors also sought but couldn’t quite achieve. Myriad analysts cast the counterterrorism expenditure and focus of the past two decades as a wasteful distraction from the real challenges of the 21st century. “We invested trillions of dollars in upgrading land forces and counterterror and counterinsurgency forces that have no applicability to the naval and air theater that is the Pacific,” Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Stars and Stripes. “Who knows what our naval modernization could look like right now had we not spent trillions of dollars for 20 years on the Army? The budget fights and fights over what the services will look like are just now getting started, when they should have started 20 years ago, given China’s naval modernization.” American debacles in the Middle East reinforced a narrative popular in Beijing about the United States’ supposedly inevitable decline on the world stage. “China has been able to capitalize on the opportunity to bide its time and build its strength,” wrote Yun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center. “The power balance between the United States and China most likely would have evolved in the same direction without 9/11. However, the resources, focus, and time the United States poured into theWar on Terror certainly expedited the shift.” That shift sits heavily on a generation of American policymakers. “In terms of geopolitical influence,” wrote former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, “the [Chinese Communist Party] has been the biggest beneficiary of the war on terror.” Ishaan Tharoor is a columnist on the foreign desk of The Washington Post, where he authors the Today’s WorldView newsletter and column.

Faruqi experienced the aftermath of the attacks differently than many other people in the United States. She is Muslim. The hijackers who flew airplanes into theWorld Trade Center, the Pentagon and a field in Pennsylvania also were Muslim. But they were part of an extremist group that believes in using violence to spread their religion. The connection between the religion and the attacks caused a steep rise in Islamophobia – the fear of, hatred of or prejudice against the religion of Islam or Muslims, people who follow the religion. Faruqi, now an author, wanted to share with kids part of what Muslims in the United States have experienced since 2001. She wrote “Yusuf Azeem Is Not a Hero,” published this week, about a fictional boy in Texas who is navigating middle school. He and his friends and family deal with Islamophobia as the country gets ready to mark the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. Through a journal given to him, Yusuf also learns of his Uncle Rahman’s experience as a boy at the time of the attacks and their aftermath. We talked to Faruqi about how she experienced 9/11 as a Muslim Pakistani immigrant in the United States, how kids are still affected by 9/11 and why she wrote this book. Q: Where were you on 9/11? A: I was in Florida studying for my bachelor’s degree. It was morning and I was still getting ready and I was on the phone with my husband. He asked, ‘Have you seen the news?’ I remember thinking, ‘This is not real.’ On subsequent days as a Muslim it became harder to process. Q: Did people start to treat you differently? A: I didn’t wear a hijab (a head covering some Muslim women wear) then, so I blended in. But if I had been in middle school or high school it would have been pretty awful, like it was for so many people I interviewed when I was writing the book. Q: How did you do research? A: I talked to adults who were kids when it happened. I had two questions: What happened on that day? I needed that for the journal written by Yusuf’s Uncle Rahman when the attacks happened. I wanted to describe what happened that morning, if school closed early or not. And I also asked how they felt about themselves and their life in general, and how people treated them after 9/11. Q: Were you surprised by what they told you? A: It wasn’t anything I didn’t know, but I still wanted to capture it. They said they felt like strangers in their own country, like their friends weren’t their friends anymore. That happens in the book, too. In the journal entries, Uncle Raman has a huge rift with his best friend. Q: Why was it important to you to write this book? A: For young readers, their whole life was shaped by 9/11. If they’re Muslim, or brown and look like they’re Muslim, they are treated like they’re the “enemy.” A lot of their parents have experienced discrimination at their jobs or lost friends. They’re on the receiving end of this hatred. I wanted to show what happens when the entire country is living in post-9/11 trauma: why there’s surveillance, and airport security, of how, if you’re Muslim you (aren’t considered) a patriot. Q: What do you hope kids learn from it? A: I hope (kids who are like Yusuf) get the message to be strong and understand what are the motivations for people (being racist). Yusuf has to finally stand up to his bullies, not only his age but adults, too. If you are not from the Muslim community, I hope reading the book can offer some tools to help neighbors who are going through discrimination, how to be allies, how to make sure you’re not one of those people causing hurt. It’s a sad book; really bad things happen. But the end is happy and hopeful. I believe the worst things are managed by the loving work you do and the actions you take. Q.: There is still a lot of Islamophobia in America. Do you think that will change? A: It’s been festering for 20 years. But I believe we can address these things by talking to people and learning about people who are different from us. Reading books, meeting people from other cultures, asking how things are. Those things go a long way. -Special To TheWashington Post By Lela Nargi How 9/11 Altered The Fiction Landscape In 13 Novels The demonic choreography of al-Qaeda’s attack on the United States instantly rendered Sept. 11 the most documented act of terrorism in human history. As the North Tower of theWorld Trade Center burned, cameras already on the scene filmed the second plane soaring into the South Tower. Those appalling images, infinitely reproduced, colonized the minds and imaginations of a generation. Almost as quickly as the U.S. military geared up to unleash America’s retribution, the publishing industry jumped into active duty, too. A nation seething with rage and incredulity felt desperate to know how the attacks of 9/11 happened, who carried them out and why. Within days, previously published books - such as Ahmed Rashid’s “Taliban” and Yossef Bodansky’s “Bin Laden” - shot up on the bestseller list. Sales of Bibles, Korans, spiritual guides, prophecy titles and works on comparative religion ascended toward the heavens. Advances in technology allowed the production and distribution of an unprecedented number of new books in record time. On Oct. 1 - while Ground Zero was still burning - students and professors at the NewYork University Department of Journalism published “09/11 8:48 am,” an anthology of accounts by survivors and witnesses. But of course, readers wanted more - so much more. Journalists and scholars, politicians and photographers, along with spiritual leaders, self-help gurus and conspiracy theorists, all rushed to their computers. Dozens of 9/11 books appeared before the end of the year; as many as 150 more by the first anniversary. If paper could have salved our wounds, we would have been healed. There was certainly an exigent need to record, analyze and explain Sept. 11, but it was not at all clear if there was a parallel need to fictionalize Sept. 11. Indeed, hours after the attacks on the Pentagon and theWorld Trade Center, the novelist Ian McEwan confessed the limits of fiction. “Even the best minds,” he wrote in the Guardian, “the best or darkest dreamers of disaster on a gigantic scale, from Tolstoy andWells to Don DeLillo, could not have delivered us into the nightmare available on television news channels yesterday afternoon.” And before the year ended, DeLillo himself suggested in Harper’s that the destruction of the towers was “a phenomenon so unaccountable and yet so bound to the power of objective fact that we can’t tilt it to the slant of our perceptions.” Literary novelists, so many of whom lived in NewYork and couldn’t get the ash of death out of their clothes, faced a barrage of practical and theoretical threats to their creative enterprise. Martin Amis wrote that, in the aftermath of 9/11, “The so-called work in progress had been reduced, overnight, to a blue streak of pitiable babble. . . . A feeling of gangrenous futility had infected the whole corpus.” By Ron Charles -Continued On Page 10 Photo by:Houghton MifflinHarvestBooksScribner —HandoutviaTheWashington Post Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close; The Reluctant Fundamentalist; The Falling Man Saadia Faruqi’s new novel “Yusuf Azeem Is Not a Hero” features a middle school student who deals with Islamaphobia as the United States marks the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Very soon, the U.S. will see the friendly side of the traditional rivalry between these two countries in the form of two business leaders whose love of cricket has brought them together. Passion For The Game Indian-Americans are among the most passionate about this sport. Families pay for channels that bring them this game wherever it is taking place in the world. They are up to date on every game, follow the players avidly, know each one by name and his history and how many sixers some player hit, whether in the Indian teams or Pakistani teams, or the English andWest Indian teams. The rise of cricket in the U.S. has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of the South Asian population in this country. Their passion for the game and campaign for it in different parts of the country has given rise over several years now, to cricket clubs which have popped up around the United States, pitches have been prepared and players recruited. Starting from neighborhood friends and informal matches, it has grown to become a serious and competitive sport with matches that pit several teams at locations in Illinois, NewYork, New Jersey, Florida and other states. And its not just grown-ups who are interested in the game. They want to get younger second-generation kids involved in cricket. The APL is the latest development in a long history of the game in this country. Rajinder Singh Mago of the Punjabi Cultural Society in Illinois, told Desi Talk about his son Satnam, who was born in the U.S., but got familiar with the game when his grandfather brought him the whole paraphernalia from India relating to cricket. “He played the game in our backyard and then his cousins visiting would join and play, and in our neighborhood playground, people from all the cricket countries would be playing league games,” Mago said. Satnam discussed cricket with his cousins in England too. Krish Vaidya, 12, of New Jersey, is even more of an expert in cricket, introduced to it by his grandfather. The three generations of family members watch the game wherever it is being live-streamed from. Krish knows the statistics of every player and discusses powerplays with his father and grandfather. Mitali Chikhalkar, 31, of New Jersey, who came to the U.S. from Mumbai, kept up her interest in following Indian cricket. “My friend and I whenever we meet, we discuss cricket. And we follow players on Instagram,” she told Desi Talk. “I love watching Indian cricket.” “Between Dallas and Fort Worth just off the Texas 130 Interstate an American cricket “Field of Dreams” is being built amidst the urban sprawl,” reported Reuters in November 2020. The USA Cricket chairman told the news outlet, “build it and they will come.” “Cricket is in my blood,” Jay Mir, founder and CEO of American Premiere League had told Desi Talk back in May as he began his venture. Originally from Lahore, Pakistan, Mir’s views on cricket match those of Sam Singh, who hails from North India, and also has cricket running in his veins. Singh has purchased one of the top cricket teams in Mir’s lineup. That historic match between the Pakistani and Indian teams is scheduled to be played September 27, 2021, at Yogi Berra Stadium in Little Falls, New Jersey. The usacricket.org website says America has one of the richest cricketing histories of any country, dating back over 300 years! USA Cricket is organized according to regional zones and matches are played routinely. But the new generation of Indians who began coming in large numbers to the U.S. since 1965 Immigration Act, has really helped the game grow. Cricket teams were formed in universities and cities, like Dartmouth, Amherst College, Mass., Philadelphia Cricket Club, to name just very few. Today, one of the big players entering this field is American Premiere League. The Aug. 30 meeting was to announce the acquisition of the Premium Indian USA Kings cricket team by businessman Singh fromMir. With American Premiere League (APL) announcing the 1st season of the seven-nation league in New Jersey, organizers declared, “Finally professional cricket has arrived in USA” Jay Mir, who had the vision to bring highest quality cricket in T20 format to NewYork, set out to make it a reality. He sought the approval from the United States Cricket Board which reports to the International Cricket Council. The ten-day cricket tournament starts on September 20th and goes on till the 30th. With two games during the day and one at night in Yogi Berra Stadium, the league follows the T20 format. The opening ceremony is set for September 13, 2021 at the stadium with top performing musical groups of Junoon and world famous Shazia Manzoor. Seven teams involved in the League include Indian, Pakistani, England, Australian, West Indies, Bangladeshi and American. Billions of Fans A sport which is followed by about two billion fans, the game has been long sought after by cricket lovers in United States. Not new to North America where U.S. and Canadian cricket teams did exist and though the game was 1st played in United States in late 1800s, it never took root. Now with about 20 million immigrants in the U.S. from countries where cricket is the 2nd religion, the game had to be launched, organizers say. Mir formed American Sports and Entertainment Group and built his plan on the lines of the Indian Premiere League (IPL). He announced the tournament as an exciting venture in summer and started to auction the teams. He sold Pakistani, English, Australian andWest Indies teams quite quickly but held on to the most coveted and sought after team of Premium Indians.

The blanket term was coined by British colonizers, possibly as an Anglicization of the Tamil word “kari,” which translates directly as “a cooked vegetable or meat.” And yet, in a column published recently in TheWashington Post magazine, GeneWeingarten reduced the food of an entire country – with more than a billion residents, millions of expats, 28 states, eight union territories and 22 official languages – to: “If you like Indian curries, yay, you like Indian food!” He then went on to dismiss Indian food as “the only ethnic cuisine in the world insanely based entirely on one spice,” by which he meant curry – a statement so incorrect that it gives away a shocking lack of knowledge about food and cooking as a whole. Within a few days of its publication, the article had traveled thousands of miles and reached the Indian masses – and I, in turn, woke up to a barrage of texts from my friends and family living in India. They seemed disappointed … in me, for working at TheWashington Post. The thought that I stand for all of The Post – a newsroom of more than a thousand journalists – is, of course, quite reductive. But no more so than the idea of “curry” representing more than 60 spices used in Indian cooking – or standing in for the vast range of dishes those spices can create, each with a unique blend of spices, nuts and herbs, differing vastly in preparation and ingredients, and from state to state. For me, the extraordinary diversity of Indian cuisine is intrinsically tied to memory, family and identity. Half of my family is from the north: Imagine white-topped hills and sapphire lakes that freeze over, kites drifting over a mustard field, road trips where camels and elephants pass you decked in gold, and celebrations marked for weeks with intricate henna on your hands. The other half is from the south: land of magnificent temples, hot blistering beach towns, lotuses, coconut trees, Kanjeevaram silk sarees, and bunches of jasmine woven through your hair. I was born in New Delhi to parents who met in Bombay (now Mumbai); we moved briefly to Orissa when I was 5, then to Maharashtra when I was 6. After my brother was born, we settled back in New Delhi, where we finished our schooling and I attended university. Our paternal grandmother (Paati) lived with us growing up, and every morning for breakfast, she would make freshly crisped dosas – flat and crepe-like, made with a fermented rice and urad dal batter – along with sambhar, a hearty tamarind soup, and a light mint coconut chutney. I haven’t tried to re-create this combination in my kitchen in Brooklyn yet for fear of ruining it. (Don’t worry; I get my fix every once in a while from a delightful restaurant in Fort Greene called Dosa Royale.) Paati’s love language is food, as is true for many Indian mothers and grandmothers. At 84, she still, for every festival, cooks our favorite sweets and savory treats – such as Mysore pak, vadai and a South Indian savory snack that is so flexible in its preparation that it tastes different in every household, and is quite literally called “mixture.” Lunch and dinner would bring a steady rotation of my mom’s aloo parathas, a North Indian staple: a flaky potato flatbread, which we typically ate along with some variation of a sabzi (any vegetable dish), a daal (any lentil dish) and rice – in numerous permutations. Mama would satisfy her sweet tooth with a recipe from her mother for a halwa: a semolina milk dessert infused with cardamom and saffron, and topped with whole cashews. New Delhi is a sacred destination for street food. The local chaat stall had tangy fillings that trained your stomach bacteria for battles they never knew they were going to have to fight. But as Anthony Bourdain said: Street food in India “won’t kill you. It won’t poison you. You are far more likely, in my long experience on the road, to get ill at the hotel buffet.” One of the first things I do when I go back is visit the gol gappa stall near my house with my brother and my childhood best friend – the same one we have been going to since we were 12. Gol gappa as it’s known in New Delhi (or paani puri in Maharashtra, or fuchka in Kolkata) is a thin and light spherical flatbread – imagine a thin bread bowl the size of a golf ball – filled with a cooked mix of chopped potato, onion and chickpeas, which is then dunked in spicy herb water and sprinkled with a tamarind chutney. Another regular haunt is the local momo stall. A staple from northeast India, as well as Tibet and Nepal, these dumplings filled with meat or vegetables taste best when doused in a special tomato chili sauce. In 2011, when I was 17, my cousin and I decided to eat a hundred momos across New Delhi over the course of the summer. We ate chicken momos, veggie momos, paneer momos, tandoori momos and cheese momos. I believe we reached 78. My favorite comfort food, and a top contender for my favorite Indian dish, is sabudana, as prepared in Mumbai. It is the one I find myself missing the most, as it’s relatively unknown outside of India, and in turn is rarely seen on any menu in America. You soak pearled tapioca overnight, saute it with cumin seeds, salt, red chili powder and green chiles, and add cooked diced potatoes and toasted peanuts, finishing it off with a garnish of coriander and a squeeze of lemon. Imagine a billion such individualized experiences across 1,269,219 square miles – where the livelihood of so many depends on the food industry, from farmers to fishermen to street vendors to chefs and even to parents who pack their children’s tiffins every morning – reduced to a denigration of “curry.” For those who would adopt such a perspective, it’s quite simply their loss – and their misunderstanding of an entire culture. Meanwhile, masalas will continue to get toasted, meats will continue to sizzle on the tandoors, and ghee will continue to glaze rotis in kitchens all over the world. -TheWashington Post By Shikha Subramaniam Photo byDeb LindseyforTheWashington Post Dosas such as these were a breakfast staple in the author’s family when she was growing up. Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Goes On Trial For Fraud Opening statements began Wednesday in the trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the blood-testing start-up founder who allegedly failed to deliver on promises of running hundreds of tests off just a finger prick of blood. Holmes, 37, faces criminal charges in federal court here for allegedly defrauding investors and patients by misleading them about the success of her bloodtesting company Theranos. Prosecutors will try to prove that Holmes knowingly made misleading statements about how well Theranos’ portable blood-testing lab worked, and how financially successful the company was. Holmes has pleaded not guilty to the charges. The former entrepreneur started Theranos when she was 19 and a student at Stanford, eventually developing it to 800 employees before media investigations revealed a dysfunctional workplace and erratic technology. Holmes’s defense team is expected to argue, at least in part, that the former CEO suffered abuse at the hands of her previous boyfriend, Sunny Balwani. In court filings unsealed last month, it was revealed that Balwani had his trial separated from Holmes’s after arguing that her plans to allege intimate partner violence would mean he could not get a fair trial. Balwani, the former president of Theranos, is charged with the same crimes as Holmes. Balwani’s legal team has disputed the allegations of abuse in court documents. Holmes could argue that Balwani “verbally disparaged her and withdrew ‘affection if she displeased him’; controlled what she ate, how she dressed, how much money she could spend, who she could interact with – essentially dominating her and erasing her capacity to make decisions,” according to filings. Holmes was evaluated by a psychologist hired by her defense, and the government also received court permission to appoint a doctor to meet with her. Holmes, who once graced the covers of Forbes and Fortune magazines, was held up as a role model to young women who were interested in the sciences and wanted to run their own company. Theranos collapsed in September 2018, nearly three years after theWall Street Journal began publishing investigations into the company’s operations, reporting that the company’s blood testing technology did not work as advertised. In January 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a report finding that “the deficient practices of the laboratory pose immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.” Theranos later agreed with CMS to stay out of the blood testing business for two years. Just months before the company shuttered, Holmes and Balwani made a deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle allegations of massive fraud. As part of the deal, Holmes would not be allowed to serve as an officer of a public company for 10 years. In a 2018 email obtained by theWall Street Journal, new Theranos chief executive David Taylor said the company had run out of money and options to secure more. The trial is expected to last 13 weeks. -TheWashington Post By Rachel Lerman Bloomberg photo byDavid Paul Morris Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos Inc., exits federal court in San Jose, Calif., on Aug. 31, 2021.

The School bestowed upon her the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Medicine, Honoris Causa, as well as a prestigious Exceptional Leadership award acknowledging her proactivity and tireless efforts in the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidentally, Honorable Evelyn Wever-Croes, the first female Prime Minister of Aruba, always wanted to be a doctor, but there was no medical school in Aruba in her youth, so she ended up becoming a lawyer. Xavier University was proud to confer this coveted honorary degree upon her. Thanking Xavier, the Prime Minister said, “I accept this honor in the name of our Government and the Crisis Team because it was teamwork that made it all happen and without the team, our country wouldn’t be where it’s at.” During her speech addressing the newest class of graduating MDs, Mrs. Wever-Croes shared 3 key thoughts that she says helped her become a better version of herself: 1, Love what you do, 2, Lead with empathy, and 3, Stay focused. We could not be more grateful to have had her share her wisdom with us that day.

It no longer felt tenable - no longer felt tolerable - to create a story in our present tense that didn’t acknowledge the singular, shared agony of that day. And yet who needed a fictional representation of the catastrophe we had all lived through and were still enduring?Why create an unreal version of the calamity that had hypnotized us into muttering, “It’s unreal”? As investigators picked through the wreckage in Manhattan, Arlington and Shanksville, Pa., the idea of a 9/11 novel sounded obscene in its redundancy, its obviousness, its galling superfluousness. What would be the purpose of such a work of fiction beyond rank sentimentality or tasteless exploitation? But if novelists were deterred, they weren’t defeated. Although their nonfiction colleagues reached Ground Zero far earlier, fiction writers eventually risked treading on that hallowed space and integrating it into their own work. Some wanted to re-create the initial surprise of the destruction - not an easy feat when any description of a clear fall day was enough to make readers brace for impact. Others caught the planes out of the corner of their eye, so to speak, tracing the contrails of grief left behind. And a few novelists ventured right into the flames to imagine the unimaginable. Their efforts were alternately profound, moving and earnest - some triumphs and some cringing misses. But within a few years, it was clear that 9/11 would leave an impact on contemporary fiction as deep as its impact on every other aspect of our culture. The selection of novels that follows gives a sense of the wide variety of approaches writers have taken over the past two decades: - “Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close,” by Jonathan Safran Foer (2005) This devastatingly tender novel is about a precocious 9-year-old boy grieving the loss of his father, who died during 9/11. Foer traces the precedence of terror from NewYork to Dresden, Germany, and when words fail - as they must - a few of the novel’s pages go entirely blank. - “Saturday,” by Ian McEwan (2005) McEwan once said, “It could well be that the great 9/11 novel - if there ever is one - will be written halfway through this century.” But he offered his own contender just four years after the attacks. The carefully crafted story is contained in a single day, Feb. 15, 2003, when a neurosurgeon in London sees a plane fall from the sky. Full of mundane activities and subterranean anxieties, it’s a chilling representation of what it means to live in an era transformed by 9/11. - “The Writing on the Wall,” by Lynne Sharon Schwartz (2005) The story about a linguist at the New York Public Library is a bracing reminder that the planes may have sailed out of the blue, but the 9/11 attacks traumatized some people who were already traumatized by earlier tragedies. Schwartz explores what it felt like to live in a city suddenly thick with markers of grief and loss. - “The Emperor’s Children,” by Claire Messud (2006) Contradicting claims about the death of irony, one of the best novels to incorporate 9/11 into its plot was about a glib coterie of cultural elites in NewYork. But then: “Look at that,” one of them says while staring out a window. “It must be a bomb or something.” In a flash, we know this story has crossed from satire to tragedy, into the trajectory of our own history. - “A Disorder Peculiar to the Country,” by Ken Kalfus (2006) When theWorld Trade Center collapses, Joyce and Marshall Harriman have their own separate reasons to be grateful: She thinks her husband was in the South Tower, and he thinks she was on United Flight 93. Alas, they’re both alive to continue tormenting each other. In this grimly comic novel, the Harrimans’ failing marriage is an emblem of larger hatreds ripping the world apart. - “The Zero,” by Jess Walter (2006) NewYork policeman Brian Remy survived the collapse of the towers, but now he’s experiencing bouts of memory loss, possibly caused by a self-inflicted head wound. He’s not certain what’s happening to him, even as he gets roped into a mysterious government mission. This darkly satiric novel examines how a nation exploits its own trauma. - “Falling Man,” by Don DeLillo (2007) Six years after saying in Harper’s, “The writer wants to understand what this day has done to us,” DeLillo published a novel “to give memory, tenderness, and meaning to all that howling space.” The story involves a lawyer who barely survives the collapse of the towers and seeks out his estranged wife. The fragmented plot and abrupt style reflect a newly shattered world. - “The Reluctant Fundamentalist,” by Mohsin Hamid (2007) In a cafe in Lahore, a Pakistani man tells an American about his once successful life in the United States before 9/11 and the resultant explosion of xenophobia. This emotionally complex story explores the conflicted feelings inspired by America’s actions and suffering. - “Netherland,” by Joseph O’Neill (2008) In this poignant, pensive novel, a Dutchman living in NewYork after the 9/11 attacks seeks relief from his loneliness by playing cricket. The game - a curiosity in America - provides a singular lens through which to examine the immigrant experience in an altered landscape. - “Next,” by James Hynes (2010) A seemingly rambling day trapped in the mind of a dude who has sneaked away from his girlfriend in Michigan to apply for a job in Texas. Hynes’s genius is the way he keeps the anxiety fueled by 9/11 in the margins until the story finally hurtles us down the asymptote of terror. - “The Lake Shore Limited,” by Sue Miller (2010) If Henry James had written about 9/11, he might have produced something like this thoughtful book. At the center is a young playwright who lost her boyfriend on Sept. 11 - just before she was about to break up with him. Saddled with that complicated grief, she struggles with how to represent feelings she isn’t supposed to feel. - “The Submission,” by Amy Waldman (2011) As construction finished on the real 9/11 Memorial, Waldman published this novel in which a similar memorial design competition is won by an architect who happens to be an American Muslim. It’s a profound and unsettling consideration of how we sanctify our national suffering and who gets to be involved. - “My Year of Rest and Relaxation,” by Ottessa Moshfegh (2018) In Moshfegh’s acerbic novel, a miserable NewYorker uses drugs to avoid the world by sleeping for months. She awakens later in 2001, still wondering how to spend her time. Later, whenever she doubts that life is worth living, she re-watches a videotape of the planes crashing into the towers. She can see a woman leaping from the 78th floor: “She is beautiful,” Moshfegh writes. “There she is, a human being, diving into the unknown, and she is wide awake.” -Special To TheWashington Post -Continued From Page 8 Poet-Diplomat Abhay K’s Translation Of Kalidasa’s ‘Meghaduta’, ‘Ritusamhara’ Win KLF Poetry Book Of The Year Award 2020-21 -NEW DELHI Poet-Diplomat Abhay K’s translation of Kalidasa’s ‘Meghaduta’ (The Cloud Messenger), and ‘Ritusamhara’ (The Six seasons), published by Bloomsbury India, have won the Kalinga Literary Festival Poetry Book of the Year Award 2020-21.

Apart from the ‘Never Forget’ memes, what does the 9/11 anniversary mean to the average American whose homeland was targeted, and whose adversaries succeeded in an evil, almost brilliantly executed mission?  Have we learned anything from that history-altering event? Is ‘Never Forget’ actionable or merely an annual memory stamp, void of meaning? My thoughts return to visiting my father during Covid isolation last year. Underneath the glass top on his dresser still lies the postcard of theWorld Trade Center (WTC) that I wrote to my parents with my thoughts days after 9/11.  Could I ever imagine any time, any event in the future, that could be more horrifying than what I witnessed 20 years ago at Ground Zero? Many years I watched the morning rollcall on 9/11, waiting for familiar names and remembering friends who shared that day with me at theWTC and the adjoining World Financial Center (WFC) complex where I worked. Most of us in the Tri-state area knew someone, or someone who knew someone, who perished that day. After the recent events in Afghanistan, the sinking feeling I hoped I’d never feel again came over me. Watching the desperate Afghans chase a moving airplane, trying to hang on, knowing the enemy was waiting below.   The days of being on edge return. On 9/11/01, prevented by the NYPD from going to my office at theWFC, I joined the crowd across the street after the 2nd plane hit.  People crying, mouths open aghast. People like me, emerging from the subway on their way to work, desperately looking for answers.  “What’s happening?!”   From across the street, I kept looking straight up and then down at the crowds’ faces for answers. The beautiful, symbolic buildings I passed through every day on my way to work, now towering infernos. “A small plane hit the tower” I heard someone say.  A woman next to me cried, covering her mouth with one hand and pointing upwards with the other.  ‘WHAT??”, I questioned before I saw it.  And then saw another as the crowd screamed in unison. People left behind, trying to decide how their life story would end.  Angels launching themselves from high up in a final act on this earth.  Visions and sounds no one can un-see or un-hear.  Horrific. Just as those in Afghanistan who in recent days attempted to control their futures, running from terror to risk jumping on the last flight to civilization and ‘freedom’, the memories of some of those left stranded in burning buildings who inched forward to make that final decision of how they wished to die that day 20 years ago came to mind. The tears watching the hopeless situation, thinking of our friends in the Towers on 9/11 turned to frantic people stampeding, pushing me out of the way as the first Tower started to fall.  Running from clouds of ash which seemed to chase us all the way to Chinatown in a strange way made me think of what some of the Afghans may have felt last week running from gunfire in the hills towards the border. In the years that passed, ‘Never Forget’ becomes ‘HOW can you forget?’ Even this evening while writing and listening to crickets chirping outside, an unusually loud airplane suddenly flew above the quiet neighborhood, disturbing sleeping llamas and the coyotes fighting underneath the stars.  Instinctively, I ran to the balcony, no different than what I did the night of 9/11 to the sounds of military planes patrolling over the Manhattan skyline.  It’s become normal for me not to ‘forget’ in some way. I’ve questioned why the media began to slowly minimize the coverage of the yearly ceremonies at Ground Zero.  The event was tragic, and no one chooses to feel uncomfortable every year, because these days “Feelings Matter” most. Many schools barely mention the deadliest event, an attack on our homeland, in their history classes. My daughter sometimes shared the story of her mom on 9/11 to her teachers in school. Why have many deliberately downplayed 9/11 and the threat that remains thereafter? How naive were we pre-9/11, and has our naiveté returned along with our amnesia? After 9/11, there was racial profiling at airports...until there really wasn’t.  Political correctness took over in parts of society. Protecting feelings trumped safety. History became a mystery. Most never understood we were in the fog of war. Invade the enemy, hunt down the culprits, eliminate them, and return home to baseball and apple pie.   “Normal life”.  End of story.  Except it wasn’t. The stories our enemies were writing were work-in-progress.  The threat, multifaceted. WhenWuhan began lockdown, when kids were beaten in Hong Kong, when women were assaulted by refugees in Europe, the response here frommany at home was usually “That’s not ‘our’ problem...”    Until it was, and is, our problem.   Our insular myopia often became our adversary’s advantage. To some, the post 9/11 years looked like we had politically correct leaders who increasingly sought to apologize, to not offend, to open doors and roll out welcome mats for those who may wish to harm us. Leaders, who cleverly attacked as ‘racists’ anyone who questioned potential threats. Shaming those awake enough to sound alarm bells to protect the homeland.  But the threats wishing to change the world and our place in it, were already within.  Some were held up high by those dismissing and clouding the historical impact of 9/11.   “Some people did something...”  they told the crowds drunk on bubbles of wokeness. Journalists were sometimes told to not use the word “terrorist” because it emotes certain “feelings”.  Feelings over facts increasingly became the war cry for many in the past two decades. Others in this country who looked “different” were sometimes treated with suspicion.  For someone like me with an Arabic-origin name, many years before and following 9/11 were filled with profiling, isolation at airports, and mistrust. People judging without knowing or speaking.  Flipping out because someone covers their head with a hijab, or triggered to safe spaces by a red baseball hat with white letters.  Anger and division are often fear in disguise.  Fear of the unknown, fear of differences....racial, political, ideological and many others. While enemies appear gifted with patience, conviction, and the eyes of tigers, we were intentionally distracted. While Blacks andWhites argued over whose lives were more supreme and mattered most, it was half-time for those foreign-looking tanned folks like me who operated under the radar, or just took a breather from the craziness. In the racial storms we picked sides, practiced synchronized group-think, swam in wokeness, and developed short attention spans thanks to tech swipe culture.   Lack of depth, lost pride in who we are as a nation, little emphasis on critical thinking, increased intolerance, loss of purpose, and no value for the oxygen that was our freedoms. A lesson frommy high school driver’s ed class re-entered my thoughts many times since 9/11.    “Look high, wide, low and check your rear view mirrors.”    Look within borders to observe divisions.  Look high, wide for dangers overseas in today’s interconnected world to understand the impacts here.  Lastly, revive common sense and monitor those rear view mirrors to know who’s got our six. The haze of war.  As Sun Tzu says, “The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.” My mind returns to the question, when I return to the postcard of the Twin Towers on my father’s dresser:  Could I ever imagine any time, or any event in the future, that could be more horrifying than what I witnessed that day, twenty years ago, on 9/11...? That next chapter is ours to write.  Not to white out, black out, cancel or have selective amnesia for moments in history that are uncomfortable to feel.  Remember those lost that day.  Learn from the past, painful as it may be, in order to prepare the next generation for what lies ahead.

The event was organized jointly by Religions for Peace, Indian Consulate and American Indian Public Affairs Committee with Global InterfaithWASH Alliance and Divine Shakti Foundation, Parmarth Niketan. It was held in honor of the recent publication of #1 bestseller ‘Hollywood to the Himalayas: A Journey of Healing and Transformation,’ the press release said. The book describes the journey of American-born Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati and the unexpected way her life was transformed when, twenty-five years ago, she traveled to India with a backpack, “and had an experience of the Divine on the sacred river Ganga. Faith, and a connection to God, became that which freed her from personal suffering and that which has led to her meaningful international work as a faith leader in the development sector, planting and nourishing seeds for peace, focusing on world health, water, sanitation and hygiene, and the rights and empowerment of women and girls.” Speakers included – 1. India’s Minister of State for External Affairs & Culture, Meenakshi Lekhi. 2. Special Adviser to the SecretaryGeneral of the UN Alice Nderitu, who is also the head of the United Nations Office of Genocide Prevention. 3. HH Pujya Swami Chidanand Saraswati, president, Parmarth Niketan, and founder and chair, Global Interfaith WASH Alliance. 4. Secretary-General, Religions for Peace Prof. Azza Karam, The event was moderated by Prof. Karam. 5. Sadhvi Bhagawati Saraswati, author of ‘Hollywood to the Himalayas’ and secretary-general, Global Interfaith WASH Alliance, Parmarth Niketan. 6. Consul General of India to NewYork Randhir Jaiswal. 7. President/Founder of the International Academy for Multicultural Cooperation, President of the Light of Awareness International Spiritual Family Audrey Kitagawa, JD. 8. Jonathan Granoff, president, Global Security Institute. After the ceremonial lighting of the lamp and recitation of auspicious prayers, Sadhvi Bhagawatiji presented each of the dignitaries on the dais a copy of Hollywood to the Himalayas. Minister of State for External Affairs and Culture Meenakshi Lekhi praised the Indian-American community for its devotion to the well-being of India. “Let me say at the outset how proud I am of all of you. We, in India, are extremely grateful to our diaspora which carries on all the traditional functions and are the ‘Ambassadors of India’ while the formal Ambassadors have formal jobs to do. But the ‘informal ambassadors’ carry the job far, far, far better and reach out to people,” Lekhi said. “The values that India stands for are exhibited by people who are away from their homes, but carry their hearts on their sleeves and always believe in and stand up for Mother India, and say ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’,” she added. She also dwelt on India’s diversity and its ancient heritage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she said, had put out the ‘clarion call from the ramparts of Red Fort, and said that India at 75 cannot be hooked up on the history, but has to reflect upon the history, to decide what next 25 years are going to be.” Minister Lekhi also spoke of the progress being made with vaccinations and development of new vaccines, and how India had helped other countries in their hour of need, and praised IndianAmericans for mobilizing help to India. Swami Chidanand Saraswati, in his speech, said he had seen how faith can harm people but also heal them.  “Faith can (also) divide or unite. The choice is ours – how we use it!” He highlighted how the power of faith had been used for practical purposes. “We used the power of faith to make people know that open defecation is total devastation. We used the power of faith to help people understand they need to build toilets, not only temples. We used the power of faith to keep our rivers and river banks clean,” Swami Saraswatiji added, calling it fitting that the East and theWest have come together at the meeting to celebrate Sadhviji’s new book. “For 25 years she has been a bridge of the East and theWest, of science and spirituality and now of the United Nations and United Creations!” Alice Nderitu praised Sadhvi Bhagawati saying she “represents those religious leaders and actors who are taking a strong stand on the protection and promotion of human rights and on the prevention of atrocity crimes at international and local levels.” “Sadhvi Bhagawati embodies the quintessence of the local peacebuilders. As United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, I will continue to partner with Sadhvi Bhagawati and other women religious actors to advance the prevention of atrocity crimes globally.” Nderitu said, offering the full support of her office. Sadhvi Bhagawatiji, in her address to the gathering, shared how the power of faith had transformed her life: “Having grown up in Hollywood with all the opportunity and all the privilege, what I didn’t have was faith or a connection to God.  Through the powerful, totally unexpected experience of Oneness with the divine that I had on the banks of the Ganga river, I realized that I am part of the sacred perfection of the universe, that I am One with all.” That experience and awareness transformed her life, she said, adding, “Now, I’ve been so blessed to be able to share the power of faith with so many others and to use it for so much good, ranging from women’s empowerment and equality to environmental protection to water preservation.” At the Sept. 9, 2021 event at the Indian Consulate in New York, for book release of Hollywood to the Himalayas.

Here was the United States, no longer just the triumphant victor of the ColdWar, but a wounded “unipolar” superpower ready to mete out justice on a global scale. The enemy was not a rival hegemonic power, but an amorphous concept (“terror”) that American leadership linked to both a web of Islamist extremists and adversarial autocratic regimes. The results were the costly invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the massive expansion of the U.S. security state, and a new global awareness of the limits - rather than the potency - of American power. In the full bloom of its post-9/11 mandate, the GeorgeW. Bush administration shrugged off the growing concerns of some European allies over its invasion of Iraq and the reprimands of top officials at the United Nations. “We’re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality,” an anonymousWhite House official, widely believed to be Republican strategist Karl Rove, told the NewYork Times Magazine in 2004. “We’re history’s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.” Two decades after 9/11, that legacy of hubris hangs overWashington, a bad odor that successive administrations have tried and failed to dispel. No matter the messiness of the U.S. withdrawal last month, polling shows the overwhelming majority of the American public still supports pulling troops out of Afghanistan. Few serious politicians in either of the country’s major parties call for new military interventions overseas. A growing body of lawmakers also wants to curb theWhite House’s powers to wage war in the first place. Former president Donald Trump argued that the United States should generally stay out of foreign conflicts, especially if it has to foot the bill for the effort. President Joe Biden, like Trump, has sought to leave the 9/11 era behind, reframing America’s foreign policy ambitions around the challenge of China. The concept of “great-power competition” is once more in vogue. In foreign capitals from Europe to Asia, officials recognize that old understandings surrounding the Pax Americana are fading. Some are losing confidence in the United States. Others sense geopolitical opportunity. The IraqWar, in particular, undermined America’s standing in the world. In September 2002, half a year before the invasion, former South African president Nelson Mandela decried the “arrogant” unilateralism of the Bush administration. “We are really appalled by any country, whether it be a superpower or a small country, that goes outside the United Nations and attacks independent countries,” he said. According to Pew polling, U.S. favorability around the world plummeted thereafter, only to recover with the election of Barack Obama, who campaigned on his opposition to the IraqWar. Obama pulled out U.S. forces deployed in the country, but he was at the helm when state failure in Iraq and Syria spawned the Islamic State and new waves of upheaval and violence. The American project in Iraq became a cautionary tale - the empire’s attempt to create a new reality, as the Bush official boasted, was a delusion. “The invasion and its chaotic, violent By Ishaan Tharoor The Taliban CaretakersWill Keep The Neighbors Up Aweek ago, anxious Afghans and credulous Biden administration officials were trying to take comfort in reports that Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar would head the Taliban’s new government in Kabul. It seemed like the least bad option. As leader of the group’s political wing, Baradar had been the Taliban’s chief representative in peace negotiations with the U.S. in Qatar, and was thought to hold somewhat more moderate views than most of the military commanders. In interviews, he promised an “inclusive” government, representing all of the country’s ethnic and tribal groups. As it turned out, Baradar may himself have been fortunate to be included in the government. Announced on Tuesday, the new caretaker administration is dominated by the Taliban’s military faction, with hardliners in key positions. Baradar is only in the third tier of the hierarchy, as one of two deputy prime ministers. He will report to Prime Minister Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, who will in turn answer to Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada. Baradar’s relegation undermines Afghan hopes for a kinder, gentler “Taliban 2.0.” Far from being inclusive, the cabinet is entirely male, overwhelmingly from the Pashtun community and has no representative from the Shiite minority. This makes it even harder to believe the group’s other reassurances, whether about women’s freedoms or religious tolerance. More alarming for the wider world, the new dispensation in Kabul abounds with men with bona fides that would be welcomed at the high tables of al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The composition of the government lengthens the odds on President Biden’s gamble that the Taliban will make common cause withWashington in the fight against jihadist terrorism. The most prominent of the hardliners in office is Sirajuddin Haqqani, a U.S.-designated terrorist with long ties to al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups. Afghans with a morbid sense of humor can now claim the $10 million bounty offered by the FBI “for information leading directly to the arrest” of their new interior minister. If Mohammed Yaqoob, the defense minister, doesn’t have Haqqani’s terrorist credentials, he more than makes up for this in lineage: He is the eldest son of Mullah Omar, the Taliban’s first supreme leader and host of Osama bin Laden. Yaqoob has supervised the Taliban’s military operations in recent years, as the group has embraced many al-Qaeda tactics, including the use of suicide bombings against civilian targets. The new intelligence chief, Abdul Haq Wassiq, completes the troika of security bosses. He is under United Nations sanctions for his role in the previous Taliban administration, when he was “in charge of handling relations with Al-Qaida-related foreign fighters and their training camps in Afghanistan.” (More than half the 33man cabinet are under UN sanctions.) If al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri could pick three men to run Afghanistan’s security services, it is a safe bet that Haqqani, Yaqoob andWassiq would have been at the top of his list. The Biden administration must assume that they will make it their business to turn Afghanistan once again a safe haven for terrorism. It is unlikely to be much of a consolation forWashington, but the government in Kabul will also alarm other countries with an interest in Afghanistan. For instance, there will be disquiet in China about army chief Qari Fasihuddin, who has had a long association with the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which Beijing accuses of terrorism in its Xinjiang province. (The Trump administration last year removed the ETIM from the State Department’s list of terrorist groups.) Meanwhile, the Shiite shutout will cause grave concern in Iran, which regards itself as protector of the minority sect. There are fears of a resumption of the persecution of the predominantly Shiite Hazara community that characterized the previous Taliban administration in the late 1990s. And there’s bad news for India, which invested heavily in Afghanistan over the past 20 years. The hardliners are all closely tied to Islamabad. The Taliban has historically sided with Pakistan in its dispute with India over Kashmir, and many Indians fear the group will contribute more than just moral support to insurgents in the restive region. Just as inWashington, fingers were crossed in Beijing, Tehran and New Delhi in the hope of a Baradar-led Afghan government. Now they must all brace for the worst.

The 469-mile roadway passes through six mountain chains in the Appalachians in Virginia and North Carolina. Operated by the National Park Service, the parkway is a planned landscape, unlike most national park areas. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated a plan for a “park-to-park” highway to connect Shenandoah National Park to Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Construction started Sept. 11, 1935, and was completed in 1987. The parkway’s 45 mph top speed limit allows visitors to slow down to enjoy the scenery. There is a plethora of opportunities to get out of the car and hike the parkway’s 369 miles of trails, along with places to bike, camp and explore cultural sites. Due to efforts to preserve historical structures, including log cabins and railways, the scenic roadway is considered a museum of the American countryside. - Best time to visit “We usually tell folks to expect peak leaf color in mid-October,” says Amy Ney, communications coordinator for the Blue Ridge Parkway Association, the marketing partner for the parkway. She adds that multiple factors can affect the timing of the leaves changing. The parkway’s elevation, which ranges from 670 feet to 6,053 feet, is one of the main indicators. “Leaves start turning first at higher elevations and on the northern slopes,” Ney says. “So the lower elevations and drier southern slopes experience fall color change later. The amount of rainfall, daytime sunshine and nighttime temperature also add to the equation, and fall storms can often blow the leaves right off the trees.” She recommends that travelers visit a long section of the parkway with a variety of elevations: “Any trail or overlook that has a long-range view will be great in fall, because you can see foliage at different elevations and have a greater opportunity to see fall color in some level of progression.” Elevation can change dramatically in just a few miles. From the lowest portion of the parkway at the James River in Virginia, the elevation increases nearly 3,300 feet over a 13-mile distance to Thunder Ridge. - How to avoid crowds During the pandemic, the Blue Ridge Parkway was extremely popular, with 14 million visits in 2020, the highest number in the national park system. “Weekdays and early in the day are both good options to avoid crowds,” Ney says. “But I also recommend looking for less-busy places along the parkway, like Wigwam Falls,” near Montebello, Va. She also suggests starting a trail in an atypical location and downloading the Blue Ridge Parkway Association’s free travel planner app. The app works offline for Android and iOS devices, and it provides a detailed list of attractions and services. - Where to go The parkway is divided into four regions, and all sights are labeled by numbered mileposts starting near Waynesboro, Va., and ending in Cherokee, N.C., with limited entry and exit points. To assist with travel planning, the Blue Ridge Parkway Association website and free app offer a detailed guide of each of the four regions, with interactive maps, and include lodging information for nearby communities. Along the parkway, there are two lodges, Peaks of Otter Lodge and the Pisgah Inn, and several campgrounds. Two sections of the parkway are closed for construction near Roanoke and combined into one detour. The road is closed from Milepost 112.2 to 115 and Milepost 121.4 to 135.9. A list of all road and facility closures can be found at nps.gov/blri, as well as regulations about masks and occupancy limits for indoor spaces. Here are some of the most photogenic spots for fall foliage, organized by region from north to south: - Ridge Region (Milepost 0-106) - Humpback Rocks (Milepost 5.8-9.3) In the 1840s, a rock-formation landmark guided wagons over the Howardsville Turnpike. This rock outcrop, known as Humpback Rocks, is a popular hike and provides views of the Rockfish and Shenandoah valleys. To avoid crowds, consider starting your hike on the Appalachian Trail from the Humpback Rocks Picnic Area (Milepost 8.5) rather than at the busy Humpback Rocks trailhead (Milepost 6). At Milepost 5.8, there’s a visitor center and an outdoor farm museum with a late 19th-century log cabin and outbuildings. - Yankee Horse Ridge (Milepost 34.4) One of the lesser-known photography spots in the Ridge Region is Yankee Horse Ridge, the site of the Irish Creek Railway, a logging railroad that operated from 1916 to 1939. Part of the narrow-gauge track has been reconstructed near the overlook of a small stream. A 0.2-mile trail leads to Wigwam Falls, one of the easiest waterfalls to access between Waynesboro and Roanoke. Although the waterfall is small, it’s tucked into a hemlock forest and is extremely photogenic. Picnic tables and a large parking area make this a great rest stop. - Plateau Region (Milepost 106-217) - Rocky Knob (Milepost 167-174) - Rocky Knob is one of the more rugged areas of the parkway with four major hiking trails, ranging in difficulty from the strenuous 10.8-mile Rock Castle Gorge Trail to an easy one-mile loop at the picnic area. The 4,800-acre area includes a campground and visitor center. - Mabry Mill (Milepost 176) One of the most-photographed spots on the parkway is Mabry Mill, built in 1908 by Ed Mabry, an entrepreneur who built and operated it for 25 years. The site overlooks a pond and includes a sawmill, wheelwright and blacksmith shop, along with a two-story house. The best time to photograph the mill with the reflection in the pond is roughly an hour before sunset. - Highlands Region (Milepost 217-339) - Linn Cove Viaduct (Milepost 304) The Linn Cove Viaduct - an S-shaped elevated roadway that hugs the side of Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina - was one of the last sections of the parkway to be completed. The 1,243-foot-long viaduct was delayed for 20 years while officials struggled with how to build a road at 4,100 feet without damaging the environment. The structure is now designated as a National Civil Engineering Landmark. To reach the viaduct, which is best photographed in the morning, park in the lot at Milepost 303.9, then follow the trail that parallels the outer edge of the guardrail to the start of the viaduct. For an elevated view, cross the road and climb the large rock, where photographers will probably be gathered. - Linville Falls (Milepost 316) The headwaters of the Linville River begin at Grandfather Mountain and form the tiered Linville Falls, which plunges into Linville Gorge, known as the “Grand Canyon of the Southern Appalachians.” The two main hiking trails lead through a hemlock forest mixed with white pine, oak, hickory and birch trees that cover the trails with a colorful blanket of leaves every October. There are four miles of trails; the best views of the falls are from the Chimney View and Plunge Basin overlooks. - Pisgah Region (Milepost 340-469) - Craggy Gardens and Pinnacle Trail (Milepost 364.6 and 364.2) This high-altitude portion of the parkway has two short but beautiful trails located a half-mile apart. Due to the harsh environment, both trails are lined with twisted and gnarled trees. The 0.7-mile Craggy Pinnacle Trail leads to a panoramic 5,892foot viewpoint, while the Craggy Gardens Trail leads through the forest from the visitor center to a picnic area with a short spur trail that offers views of the nearby town of Montreat and the Black Mountain Range. Even if the weather is clear at lower elevations, fog and clouds can obstruct views on both trails. - Mount Mitchell State Park (Milepost 355.4) Towering at 6,684 feet, Mount Mitchell is the highest peak in North Carolina and the Eastern United States. The mountain is located in a 1,855-acre North Carolina state park and is accessible only from the parkway via a state highway. Visitors can hike or drive to the observation deck for 360-degree views. The expansive picnic area at the top is a wonderful lunch spot to socially distance. 11 News India Times September 17, 2021 On Blue Ridge Parkway, autumn is for reds Travel The Washington Post By Anna Mazurek Photo:   Anna Mazurek The Linn Cove Viaduct - an S-shaped elevated roadway that hugs the side of Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina - was one of the last portions of the Blue Ridge Parkway to be completed.
