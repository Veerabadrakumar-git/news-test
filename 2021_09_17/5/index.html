 www.newsindiatimes.com  – that’s all you need to know Campaign To Recall Indian-American Councilwoman In Seattle T he Seattle Times reported that the campaign to recall Indian- American Councilwoman of Seattle Kshama Sawant, had submitted sig- natures on a petition that calls for a special election this coming winter. Sawant, a member of the Socialist Alter- native party, was elected as far back as in 2013 and entered the Council in 2014. She is the only member from Socialist Alterna- tive to be elected to public office. She is also a member of Democratic Socialists of America. According to the Seattle Times news report Sept. 8, 2021, the Recall Sawant campaign began collecting signatures in April and needs the King County Elec- tions to validate at least 10,687 of the signatures from Sawant’s District 3 voters. If that many signatures are validated, out of the more than 16,000 collected so far, the special election will have to be held between 45-90 days after the validation, said the Times. The Recall Sawant petition claims Sawant used city resources to promote the “Tax Amazon” ballot initiative, as well as allowing members of the public to enter City Hall during protests when Covid re- strictions were in place in early June, 2020, Seattle Times reported. According to  socialistalternative.org, Sawant won her first election with over 90,000 votes, to become the first socialist in Seattle to win an election in nearly one hundred years. She was re-elected in 2019 securing 52 percent of the vote, according to aWashington Post report. Sawant, a former software engineer, has been a forceful campaigner for the $15 minimum wage initiative, and a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as well as relentlessly pursuing the Tax Amazon effort. A November 2019 report after that year’s elections, carried in TheWashing- ton Post, noted Sawant’s strong backing for tax on large companies and the $15 minimum wage. “But Sawant’s campaign for reelection this year pitted her against Amazon, Seattle’s largest private employ- er, more conspicuously than ever,” the report noted, adding, “The retail giant has put $1.5 million toward City Council races this cycle, via a business-interest group that spent nearly half a million dollars in support of Sawant’s opponent—a mas- sive expansion of the company’s efforts to shape politics on its home turf.” Sawant’s victory was hailed by left Democrats including Sen. ElizabethWar- ren, D-Massachusetts. “Nobody in Seattle has caused more headaches for the political establishment over the past seven years than Kshama Sawant,” the Socialist Alternative says on its website.

Bangladeshi Couple Sentenced For ‘Conspiring To Provide Material Support To ISIS’ A husband and wife, originally from Bangladesh, were sen- tenced to prison for conspiring to provide material support to ISIS, a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization. According to a Sept. 9, 2021, press re- lease from the office of the  United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Penn- sylvania, Shahidul Gaffar, 40, and Nabila Khan, 35, both residents of Pennsylvania, were sentenced to 18 months and two years in prison, respectively, by United States District Court Judge Joshua D. Wol- son who also sentenced both defendants to three years of supervised release. According to court documents sourced in this press release, in 2015, Gaffar and Khan, a married couple originally from Bangladesh, provided and attempted to provide financial support to two of Khan’s brothers who traveled to Syria to join ISIS fighters. Gaffar and Khan discussed the broth- ers’ travel plans in detail with each other, as well as with the brothers and other family members, as early as September 2014. In January 2015, Khan asked her sister living in Bangladesh to sell some of Khan’s gold and provide the money to their oldest brother, J.K., including for the other brother I.K., both identified only by their initials in the press release, in order to assist him in travelling to Syria. The press release quotes a series of email exchanges between the husband and wife on the ‘conspiracy’. One of the brothers , I.K. was ultimately killed in the fighting in Syria in March 2019. “The defendants encouraged and financially supported the efforts of Nabila Khan’s brothers to join the murderous terrorist group ISIS, which is a direct threat to the United States,” Acting United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Jennifer Arbittier Williams, is quoted saying in the press release. By a StaffWriter and destabilizing aftermath shattered the notion that the United States is indispensable and a force for democ- racy,” Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Today’sWorldView. “Had there been no invasion of Iraq, the mythology of Ameri- can exceptionalism at home and abroad would have persisted among elites for a lot longer.” Rather than being in history’s driv- ing seat, America’s policy elites are more aware that they, too, are passengers. The expensive, bloody entanglements in Afghanistan and Iraq ran alongside an epochal financial crisis that shocked the global economy. The United States recov- ered better than many other developed countries, but a necessary inwardness set in, with many politicians more preoccu- pied by the need for renewal and rebuild- ing at home than calls for intervention abroad. “9/11 has shattered the U.S. pretension to global indispensability,” wrote StephenWertheim of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Two decades more and the United States might yet become a nation among nations, no longer lording its power over others to get what it needs.” But the United States does still appear to be girding itself for another confron- tation. The Biden administration is attempting to pull off the strategic pivot to Asia - where China looms - that its predecessors also sought but couldn’t quite achieve. Myriad analysts cast the counterterrorism expenditure and focus of the past two decades as a wasteful distraction from the real challenges of the 21st century. “We invested trillions of dollars in upgrading land forces and counterterror and counterinsurgency forces that have no applicability to the naval and air the- ater that is the Pacific,” Gregory Poling, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Stars and Stripes. “Who knows what our naval modernization could look like right now had we not spent trillions of dollars for 20 years on the Army? The budget fights and fights over what the services will look like are just now getting started, when they should have started 20 years ago, given China’s naval modernization.” American debacles in the Middle East reinforced a narrative popular in Beijing about the United States’ supposedly inevitable decline on the world stage. “China has been able to capitalize on the opportunity to bide its time and build its strength,” wrote Yun Sun, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center. “The power balance between the United States and China most likely would have evolved in the same direction without 9/11. However, the resources, focus, and time the United States poured into theWar on Terror certainly expedited the shift.” That shift sits heavily on a generation of American policymakers. “In terms of geopolitical influence,” wrote former Obama adviser Ben Rhodes, “the [Chi- nese Communist Party] has been the big- gest beneficiary of the war on terror.” Ishaan Tharoor is a columnist on the foreign desk of The Washington Post, where he authors the Today’s WorldView news- letter and column.
