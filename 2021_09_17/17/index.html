 17 News India Times September 17, 2021 START-UP VISA PROGRAM PATH TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY NPZ Law Group, PC Tel: 201-670-0006 x 107 Toll Free: 866-599-3625 www.visaserve.com Immigration C anada boasts its Start-up Visa (“SUV”) program as first if its kind in the world, linking immi- grant entrepreneurs with experienced private sector organizations that have expertise working with start-up immi- grant entrepreneurs. This is also a path to obtain Canadian Permanent Resi- dency. To be eligible for SUV, an entre- preneur should portray their skills and potential to build business in Canada which is unique, can create jobs in Canada and can compete on a global scale. They should arrange support from one of the designated organizations – Venture Capital Funds, Angel Investor Groups, or Business Incubators. These designated organizations are approved to invest or support possible start-ups through the SUV program. Each organi- zation follows their own intake process for proposals and criteria to review each business proposal. The investment can vary from as low as $75,000 for an Angel Investor Group to $200,000 for a Venture Capital Fund. To make a concrete submission to IRCC, an Entrepreneur should have a qualifying business, obtain a letter of support from a designated organization, meet language requirements (CLB 5 in listening, writing, speaking and reading) and must have sufficient funds to support themselves along with their dependents in Canada. While the Application for Permanent Residency un- der the SUV program is pending, an applicant may also apply for a temporary work permit to enter Canada and start building their business. At NPZ, our U.S. and Canadian Immigra- tion Lawyers seek to assist clients with regard to employment and family im- migration issues.
