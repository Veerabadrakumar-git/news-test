Enrolled Agent with IRS. 07/30-07/22/22-sd The Prime minister of Aruba Evelyn Wever-Croes awarded the Honorary Degree in Medicine A ruba: Xavier University School of Medicine honored to host Aruba’s Prime Minister, Mrs. Evelyn Wever- Croes, at the annual Graduation Ceremony which took place in Aruba this year for the first time on August 14th, 2021. The School bestowed upon her the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Medicine, Honoris Causa, as well as a prestigious Exceptional Leadership award acknowledging her proactivity and tire- less efforts in the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Incidentally, Honorable Evelyn Wever-Croes, the first female Prime Minister of Aruba, always wanted to be a doctor, but there was no medical school in Aruba in her youth, so she ended up becoming a lawyer. Xavier University was proud to confer this coveted honorary degree upon her. Thanking Xavier, the Prime Minister said, “I accept this honor in the name of our Gov- ernment and the Crisis Team because it was teamwork that made it all happen and with- out the team, our country wouldn’t be where it’s at.” During her speech addressing the newest class of graduating MDs, Mrs. Wever-Croes shared 3 key thoughts that she says helped her become a better version of herself: 1, Love what you do, 2, Lead with empathy, and 3, Stay focused. We could not be more grateful to have had her share her wisdom with us that day.
