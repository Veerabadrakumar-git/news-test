You are likely to enjoy the company of your near and dear ones in this week in a social gathering. Someone may come from afar specifically to meet you. Good understanding and mutual respect is likely to enhance togetherness for the newlyweds. A drive round the country- side is possible and may provide a welcome break from the routine. TAURUS: It is best to have a straight talk with someone to sort out a long pending issue. An out of town leisure trip is possible for some and promises much excitement.
