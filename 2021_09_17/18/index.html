 www.newsindiatimes.com  – that’s all you need to know was looking for an enterprising businessman who would bring in the best to APL with a premium Indian team, the press release said. In came Sam Singh to fill that gap. A successful, fast-growing businessman, especially in the entertainment space in United States, Singh naturally gravitated to sports and was a natural for taking up Mir’s Indian team. Singh, along with his Chief Consultant Sunil Hali, a veteran in marketing, entertainment and media space, worked closely with Mir to reach a deal. The rest is now history in the making, as Sam Singh becomes the 1st and proud owner of Premium Indians USA KINGS, the Indian team for AP, the press release said. That landmark acquisition, was what resulted in the August 30, high-profile event where the formal announcement of the acquisition was made at the Lake Chateau inWoodbridge, N.J. More than 100 guests from the Tri-state area, including leading media were present that evening as Singh made what is consid- ered an historic announcement, and one greeted with much excitement. “Good evening everyone. I am humbled with your presence to join us on this historic day when we are making a dream come true,” Singh said. “We all have lived with cricket since childhood. Amongst many other things that we missed all these years in USA, cricket is certainly on top of the list,” he added. “We watch Cricket on TV, in cinema halls and online. But we still were missing the real-life experience. Now the moment is here.” Singh said he got the opportu- nity to explore cricket in reality in America. “And obviously I took the Indian team to represent our nation. I am working day and night with my team and APL to make sure we present true and competitive cricket,” Singh said, adding, “While as a sportsman I wish every team a great suc- cess but my dream is to win the 1st season and you all to join to cheer our team in every game.” He assured those present the game would be ‘exciting and sat- isfying especially when you each come with family and friends.” He urged everyone to come for every game to make the APL matches a great success. “I thank Jay Mir, chairman of APL who has created this event. Lets celebrate American Pre- miere League!” Hali expanded on the plans to present the Premium Indians in best possible way and target to win the 1st season which has a winning prize of $75,000 and a viewership of 5 million plus non- resident Indians. “We plan to have a very com- petent team that will be highly professional and play the game in the best way. We are aware of the expectations and building the team with great care. It is a long haul over next few seasons when we will take the game to the highest level and make it an international cricketing event in coming years”. Mir was highly appreciative of Sam Singh for stepping forward and buying the Premium Indians USA Kings. Mir looks forward to a close association with Singh to build APL as Premium Indians is the hottest team, the press release said. Mir has a vision to build APL with more teams in coming years from countries which have strong community presence in the U.S., the press release said. “I want to bring communi- ties together and build through cricket,” Mir is quoted saying. Asif Jamal, President of APL and COO of ARY Digital North America, was all praise for Mir launching such gigantic enter- prise. Jamal was among the first to join the project from ARY Digital. And provided full support to Mir to get the project off the ground. “ARY Digital has been in fore- front when it comes to cricket in sub-continent. And now we are with cricket from 1st day as it enters in USA,” said Jamal. The event was attended by prominent Indian and Pakistani Americans.
