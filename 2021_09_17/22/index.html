 www.newsindiatimes.com  – that’s all you need to know T he India International Film Festival of Boston (IIFFB) released its 2021 schedule with a host of films to be screened over a weekend on September 24, 25, 26, 2021. The organization called earlier on film fans to sign on to get an early bird discount, but also indicates it is open for getting film submissions. This will be IIFFB’s 4th festival. Accord- ing to its website, the organization aims to “engage in cultural conversations by finding commonality through the film to build lasting relationships and reflect the growing Indian American community in Boston.” Its roster includes independent films, panels and events that reflect the diversity of India and its diaspora. This year Aruna Irani, a Bollywood actress, will receive the Lifetime Achieve- ment Award 2021. The categories of films at IIFFB 2021 include feature films, shorts, comedy, documentary or VR/AR/ MR project, urging filmmakers to take advantage of the opportunity to get work in front of the press, the film industry, and audiences. “We’re bringing together creative people from so many different indus- tries, making the IIFFB Film Festival an unparalleled experience at the forefront of discover, creativity, and innovation,” organizers declare. Films need to be submitted through FilmFreeway (https:// filmfreeway.com/IndianInternational- FilmFestivalofBoston) but the IIFFB cura- tors’ committee also accepts “high-quali- ty” films directly from producers, directors and distributors, etc., they say. Over the years, the festival has featured early Independent films like “Shakespeare Walla” (1964), “The Guru” (1965), to “Room with a View” (1985), and “Howards End” (1992). “In recent years we have seen the crossover phenomena but while most of us see “Bollywood” as the dominant In- dian film genre one must not forget that throughout the history of Indian Cinema some of the greatest directors and ac- tors have crossed these cultural bridges “One Reel at a Time”,” notes IIFFB on its website. Among the subject-matter covered by IIFFB, or what it calls ‘Festival Tracks’ – are films that cover – American Born Confused Desi (ABCD), Feature Length films, LGBTQ films, Documentaries, Social Justice, Desi Born Confused Abroad (DBCA), Women’s Empowerment, Youth films, and Shorts. Among the nominations in various cat- egories are - short films so far chosen for this year’s festival – ‘TheWEAPON’ about Turkey; ‘TheWarWithin’ by Javid Farah- ani about a paralyzed man who has lost his legs due to a car accident and is now staying home, buying and selling dollars; ‘After Amal’ by Tanni Chaudhuri that goes into lineage and anthropology; ‘Sheer Qorma’ by Faraz Arif Ansari; ‘Thank you lockdown’ about how the Covid lockdown actually brings unexpected happiness in the life of a lonely woman; ‘Declaration of a Revolution’ – “A story of the largest sustained peaceful protest in history” involving Indian farmers; and ‘Runn!’ – an observation of “an intricate network of people, plants and animals, challenging our notion…” A documentary, ‘Kashmir’s Troubled Waters’ by Iqbal Chand Malhotra, is also on the roster for IIFFB 2021. Feature films listed in nominations include – ‘NOI’ by Reema Borah, about a middle-aged fisherman in a fishing village across the Brahmaputra; ‘Firastya’ about a village boy having big dreams; ‘Am I Next’ by Rahat Kazmi; ‘Destination Zindagi … kabhi rukti nahin’ – the journey as a wife, mother, widow keeping her family to- gether despite the hardships, and several others.
